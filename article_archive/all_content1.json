","_posts/2020/05/2020-05-16-scoob-2020.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Save your $20-$25 ladies and gentlemen! &lt;em&gt;Scoob!&lt;/em&gt; tells a formulaic story of how Scooby-Doo and Shaggy meet; befriend Fred, Velma, and Daphne, and are now on a mission to stop antagonist Dick Dastardly- and yes, that’s his name and yes they make fun of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you love Scooby-Doo the nostalgia is here and you may enjoy seeing these characters again. Scooby and Shaggy’s evolving friendship is admirable and the single redeemable quality of the film is when one of them begins to feel betrayed when the other begins to get more attention. This was done in a way that could connect with audiences who can understand the heartbreak that happens when friends change. Unfortunately this single plot point is very brief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scoob’s main problem is it’s predictable story, as the villain Dick Dastardly’s main objective is flat out stupid as Dick plans to release a destructive three headed dog that will end life as we know it. Very forgettable narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/2020/04/2020-04-26-tigertail-2020.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tigertail&lt;/em&gt; is a new Netflix original film from director/writer/producer Alan Yang, and tells the story of a Taiwanese man’s journey to America, and the difficult choices he faces along the way and as a result. This is Yang’s first directorial feature, and he creates a personal, simple, and poignant story about family, relationships, and identity with this film. At a terse 1h 30m runtime, &lt;em&gt;Tigertail&lt;/em&gt; still implements deliberate pacing in order to bring out the details of this story, and provide time for the story’s themes and characters to simmer and develop. Ultimately, the film is somewhat of a mixed bag, with certain moments that feel more artificial and amateurish than others, but the story still contains a resounding potency that does resonate. Yang keeps the narrative focused, even if he doesn’t break a lot of new ground, and ensures that the story remains perceptively grounded through its characters. &lt;em&gt;Tigertail&lt;/em&gt; may not necessarily pack a complete emotional wallop, but still manages to tell a story that will strike a chord with audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/i8lp_eI78ZM&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tzi Ma (you’ll recognize him from &lt;em&gt;The Farewell&lt;/em&gt;) is very good as an older version of Grover, the main character of the film. He perfectly embodies the embittered and jaded personality of his character, while also channeling the difficult confrontations he has with regrets of his past. Ma gives probably the best performance of the entire ensemble cast here, although Hong Chi-Lee and Kunjue Li are both good as young Grover and young Zhen Zhen. Christine Ko also provides a mostly solid and convincing turn as Angela in the film as well. The film is technically well-helmed too, and there is a focus on detail, despite the small-scale production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tigertail&lt;/em&gt; is a film that is focused squarely on its characters, and the emotional struggles with memory that they face. In particular, it acts as a rather compelling character study for Grover’s character, who is caught within the midst of his turbulent past and present colliding. As his story is presented, Yang depicts his character as realistically flawed but also through an empathetic lens, which makes for a well-fleshed out and engaging narrative. Furthermore, &lt;em&gt;Tigertail&lt;/em&gt; takes its time to build its simple story, and the slow pacing still manages to make for compelling storytelling, simply because of how well thought out the characters are. There are times the film does falter however, and the constant narrative back-and-forth can sometimes give the movie an inconsistent and even amateurish quality. Additionally, there are times that the writing can feel a bit artificial and make the emotions in certain scenes feel slightly forced. Yet, despite the flaws, the poignancy of &lt;em&gt;Tigertail&lt;/em&gt; comes through as the film’s message of empathy shines through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, &lt;em&gt;Tigertail&lt;/em&gt; isn’t very groundbreaking but proves to be a promising start to Alan Yang’s burgeoning directorial career. It’s a refreshingly character-driven and simple, but elegantly told, film that is worth a watch.&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/2020/04/2020-04-13-defending-jacob-2020.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Defending Jacob&lt;/em&gt; is a suspensefully thrilling and well-acted 8 episode mini-series that will premiere on Apple’s relatively new streaming service, AppleTV+. The first 3 episodes will be released on April 24th and then you can expect one new episode each subsequent week on Fridays. If you do not currently have an AppleTV+ subscription, now is the time to get one! If you have purchased an Apple product AppleTV+ is included for one year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XQfeoRLvfqU&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the novel by William Landay, a gruesome murder takes the citizens of Newton, Massachusetts by surprise! Well-renowned District Attorney Andy Barber (Chris Evans, &lt;em&gt;Knives Out, Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;) begins to look at who may have caused this mayhem until his 14-year old ill-mannered, yet well-cared for, son Jacob (Jaeden Martell, &lt;em&gt;It, Knives Out&lt;/em&gt;) becomes a suspect. Andy and his wife Laurie (Michelle Dockery, &lt;em&gt;Downton Abbey&lt;/em&gt;) become stricken with anxiety as they want to believe in their son’s innocence. The show takes us on an exceptionally enthralling ride filled with great reveals, tense court scenes, and an unpredictable outcome that made it the most entertaining form of TV/Film I’ve seen in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Chris Evans and Jaeden Martell both came from Ryan Johnson’s who-dun-it, Knives Out, to do this murder mystery and they are excellent with communicating an interesting father-son relationship that doesn’t feel perfect but realistic. The performances of Evans and Dockery are also commendable as you will cherish the duo’s relationship as husband and wife and the love that they hold for Jacob. From tears to quivering voices during serious conversations, the audience will form a desire to see Jacob be innocent because if he isn’t that will result in these parent characters (who have been nothing but well-meaning parents) unfathomable agony. This is Chris Evans’s best performance by a large margain- his determination motivated by love for his child was captivating to watch. Supporting characters also deliver exceptionally well performances. J.K. Simmons plays Jacob’s imprisoned grandfather and Cherry Jones plays Jacob’s defense attorney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of these characters is what allows &lt;em&gt;Defending Jacob&lt;/em&gt; to pull on your heartstrings and evoke thrills effectively. Because the protagonist and his wife are likable characters, you want to see them win. Additionally, the plot has some pleasantly shocking reveals that don’t quite prove but do suggest that Jacob may have been involved in the murder. Martell’s performance, his well-written dialogue and the suggestive evidence will evoke conflicted emotions. From taking a knife to school to an odd social media post, you will see Jacob’s parents and yourself asking, “Why would you do that!?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pacing moves along quickly, especially with the first three episodes. However, the middle set of episodes are slightly lackluster in comparison to the firepower of the opening ones. Details, such as Jacob being evaluated for potentially having a “killing gene” that his grandfather has, were interesting but not necessary. There’s a few details that are explored that seemed to prolong what probably could have been 5 episodes (or a 2.5 hour film). However, this quandary was truly the only single minor “flaw” I could point out. Those who love these characters as I did may not mind the extra length of time we are able to spend with these characters in these middle episodes but just may note the slower pacing. The conclusion is off-the-walls bananas and you will be rewarded with some fascinating dramatic events if you stay tuned til the end!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Production elements that stood out the most to me were the music and color grading. Composer Atli Örvarsson (&lt;em&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean&lt;/em&gt; series) develops a score that compliments the thrills you are sure to experience! Additionally, the color grading is filled with lots of blues and cool-saturated colors that give off a sense of dread, eeriness, and that consistent palette made the series one that was aesthetically beautiful to look at.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/2020/03/2020-03-25-the-hunt-2020.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;The Hunt is a dark humorous satire, focusing on a group of people who wake up outside in the middle of nowhere hands bound and mouths gagged. These conservative civilians must work together in order to avoid being hunted by their elitist captors. The Hunt is entertaining garbage that I had an enjoyable time watching. Throughout the first 30 minutes, we see multiple characters that you think will be important be brutally murdered! Characters are disposable and there’s not too much depth to anyone; however The Hunt knows it’s satire. It uses its unpredictable anyone-can-die-at-any-time setup to its advantage by catapulting the viewer into an immensely tense experience. Halfway through the quick paced 90 minute slaughter you will eventually follow a likable protagonist played by Betty Giplin who is smart, interesting, and can kick butt! I’m not political and there’s several political underlying messages that went way over my head. However, I was still able to appreciate the dark thrill ride!&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/2020/03/2020-03-20-never-have-i-ever.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Never Have I Ever&lt;/em&gt; is an upcoming Netflix series, produced by Mindy Kaling and starring Maitreyi Ramakrishnan in the lead role as Devi. The show, which premieres on April 27th, is a coming-of-age comedy-drama about the trials and tribulations of a first-generation Indian-American girl who is a sophomore in high school. The first date announcement trailer has now been released to the public, and while it’s more of a short teaser, the series already has begun to look promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6b0XhByYzv4&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this short trailer, we see Ramakrishnan debut her role as Devi as she partakes in an amusingly practical and conversational prayer at the makeshift temple in her home, hoping for a better high school year. Just through this small clip, it seems that producer Kaling and the creative minds behind the show are bringing a more realistic and grounded version of the Indian-American experience that is rarely seen on-screen. The dialogue stands out as particularly strong in this clip, as the series seems to already be breaking many of the stereotypes previously attached with so many Indian-American characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American entertainment industry has seen a real gap for truly strong Indian-American representation onscreen, especially for young adults. Apart from looking to be a truly hilarious new show, &lt;em&gt;Never Have I Ever&lt;/em&gt; looks to break new ground in terms of representation onscreen and promises to provide a narrative that will feel more authentic and lived-in.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/2020/03/2020-03-17-richard-jewell-on-blu-ray-digital-today.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;You can buy Richard Jewell digitally, on Blu-Ray, or DVD today! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Jewel is riveting, based on a true story that took place in 1996, and involves a security guard named Richard Jewell who saves people by alerting authorities about a bomb. Jewel gets to be known as a hero for a few days until investigators tragically begin to believe that he staged the event to get attention. Paul Walter Hauser plays Jewel so realistically. The screenplay effectively will cause you to feel sympathetic for everything Richard Jewell and his mother played by Kathy Bates go through. Supporting cast members Sam Rockwell and Olivia Wilde also deliver strong performances; although Olivia’s portrayal of a reporter not being historically accurate has sparked controversy. Nonetheless, Richard Jewl is entertainingly informative.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/2020/03/2020-03-11-i-still-believe-2020.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;I grew up and actually worked on staff as a Video Editor at a popular non-denominational Christian church in Corpus Christi called &lt;a href=&quot;https://churchunlimited.com/&quot;&gt;Church Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;, listening to the contemporary Christian artist Jeremy Camp, the person that this film is based on. Not only did our church play music by Camp, but we actually had the artist himself visit and host a filled-to-capacity concert that was incredible. &lt;em&gt;I Still Believe&lt;/em&gt; is a film that is targeting an audience member like myself but I truly believe (no pun intended) that it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; actually appeal to a wider secular audience too. The film is saddening, heartwarming, and displays the admirable faith of two people who endure an excruciating hardship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Za7-Q8YURM&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on a true story and the Christian artist’s memoir, KJ Apa (Riverdale) portrays a confident Jeremy Camp who falls in love with a beautiful woman named Melissa, played by Britt Robertson, during their time in college. The film shows how the young duo fall in love and eventually marries, despite knowing that Melissa is dying due to cancer. Unfortunately, Melissa continues to be unfathomably sick and this film displays the couple’s struggle while hoping and trusting in God. Gary Sinise and Shania Twain play Camp’s supporting parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme of continuously finding hope in the midst of unbearable pain is evident in this film. Christians will be able to relate to and find the faith that this couple has to be beautiful. Secular audiences may find their resilience to be charming or I could also see them finding it to be contrived, or fake, because it is hard to imagine the faith-filled response that Camp’s character has in response to many of the terrible life-changing events that happen. I personally found it commendable. Regardless of the type of audience member seeing the film, everyone will love the protagonist and the way that he loves his wife. Despite how their faith is perceived, people want to be loved the way Jeremy loved- unconditionally and at a significant other’s side until the end. KJ Appa gives an emotional, charismatic, and realistic portrayal of a man who has found the love of his life and is going to stand by her side, trusting in God, no matter what challenges that they face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of the plot and timing of a few events did make the story feel as if it was being rushed along and that the filmmakers had minimal interesting in-between moments after pivotal events. Particularly, there’s one moment where Jeremy and Melissa are in a conflict. Camp heads back to his hometown and as soon as he arrives, he must drive all the way back because something terrible has happened to Melissa. This certainly helps the pacing, as the 1 hour and 56 minutes is quick-and-to-the-point with key events falling one after another. Additionally, because the film is based on true events and, as incredible as those events may seem, if this is the way that they unfolded then it only makes sense for them to tell this story in this manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with the true life events I urge you not to look them up, as this film may not end the way that you think it will and it is this realistic and raw ending, in which I was actually unfamiliar with, that pulled on a heartstring. I would like to use more adjectives to describe how I felt but divulging that may nudge you to predict what happens. With that being said, I recommend &lt;em&gt;I Still Believe&lt;/em&gt; if you are interested in seeing two people go on a scary roller coaster and stay committed to each other while trusting in God, despite the fear that they carry.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/2020/03/2020-03-09-emma-2020.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emma.&lt;/em&gt;, the film adaptation of Jane Austen’s classic novel, is a retelling of a well-known story done with finesse, immaculate technical craftsmanship, and deft performances. This is a seemingly faithful adaptation done with relatively few narrative bells and whistles (don’t expect the likes of the time-jumping narrative found in Greta Gerwig’s &lt;em&gt;Little Women&lt;/em&gt;) that still resonates thanks to the timelessness of its plot and characters. Director Autumn de Wilde and writer Eleanor Catton adapt Austen’s source material with a loving spirit, embracing its characters’ dynamic personalities and the story’s wry and witty take. What gives Emma its strongest revitalization, however, is easily its performances, headlined by a dependably good Anya Taylor-Joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Emma.&lt;/em&gt; brims with visual brilliance, as each frame bursts with gorgeously rendered pastel colors and detailed production/costume design. The cinematography by Christoper Blauvelt is gorgeous, and gives the movie a rich visual texture complete with beautifully composed shots and expansive landscapes. Much attention is also given to getting the details right in this period piece, with production design and costume design that brings the film to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performances by just about everyone in this film remain excellent throughout. Anya Taylor-Joy is fantastic as Emma, and plays the character with a great deal of subtlety. Mia Goth is great here as well as Harriet, as is the rest of the ensemble cast. Everyone here is giving strong performances and working effortlessly with one another to provide a complete cinematic experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, director Autumn de Wilde’s adaptation gives Jane Austen’s work a fresh new cinematic vision with a talented cast. The story of &lt;em&gt;Emma.&lt;/em&gt; is light-hearted and frothy, with great flourishes of wry humor and terrific characters. This adaptation does a good job of making sure the entire ensemble cast gets a moment to shine, and the performers live up to the challenge. Ultimately, the story of &lt;em&gt;Emma.&lt;/em&gt; is somewhat slight, but the story’s strong characters remain a strength in this film adaptation as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emma.&lt;/em&gt; isn’t a groundbreaking or particularly inventive adaptation, but it’s a solidly crafted film that provides a slight cinematic change-of-pace from most of the film fare currently playing in theaters.&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/2020/03/2020-03-06-the-way-back-2020.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Ben Affleck was seemingly on his way to having one of the best comebacks in Hollywood. He started off the previous decade with &lt;em&gt;The Town&lt;/em&gt; which garnered huge critical and commercial success. He would earn an Oscar with the excellent &lt;em&gt;Argo&lt;/em&gt; and be in one of the best films of the decade, &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt;. However, as the second half of the decade began, his career began to go back in the previous direction. The casting as Batman didn’t turn out so great (I thought he was fantastic; the films not as much) and then starring in flops like &lt;em&gt;Live by Night&lt;/em&gt;. Ironically enough, director Gavin O’Connor’s career follows in that same vein. O’Connor starting the decade off with the massive hit &lt;em&gt;Warrior&lt;/em&gt; seemingly put him on a pedestal to follow it up. Unfortunately, that was followed up &lt;em&gt;Jane Got a Gun&lt;/em&gt; and his first partnering with Affleck with &lt;em&gt;The Accountant&lt;/em&gt;. Both were far from the success the two and the studio thought the films would be. Here we are now with &lt;em&gt;The Way Back&lt;/em&gt; which O’Connor dropped &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad 2&lt;/em&gt; for. But is it any good?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GhtTc7R8yBk&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affleck stars as Jack Cunningham, a small town basketball hero who is decades from his
heydays. Now an alcoholic who has marital issues, Jack gets another chance at redemption when he is called up to coach his former high school’s basketball team. Per usual, Affleck brings a pretty good performance as Cunningham. He is forced to be dynamic with playing such an
intricate character and he does it to a tee. Al Madrigal
and Janina Gavankar play the next notable roles and they are just fine in the film. The rest of the supporting cast is not memorable at all but at least don’t fall into bad. The performances of the kids on the basketball team range from decent all the way down to “is this your first time on screen.” It’s disappointing because sports movies offer an outstanding opportunity for attention-grabbing performances from the supporting actors in the team roles..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with the positive elements, the story penned by Brad Ingelsby has a very positive message about redemption that, while done before, isn’t cheesy enough to blow it off. The film does know when to be funny to break some of the dramatic tension in the film which is always great to see. One big part of the film is the basketball team section which I did get invested in, getting excited and sad through the ebbs and flows of the season. There are also clever pockets throughout that stuck with me after leaving the theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the film is far from perfect. The plot is overly predictable through its first two acts and the construction doesn’t carry the film enough to let it slide. The third act does have its twists and turns but by that time it was too late. My one big issue is how unbalanced the film. Going into the film you would believe the basketball team was a majority of the movie and we build with the team and learn and connect with them. In reality, &lt;em&gt;The Way Back&lt;/em&gt; decides to prioritize Jack’s personal life way more than basketball, which is fine but when the basketball section is the best part of the film, you lose a ton. I did not get connected to the players enough other than the best player on the team, which is far from enough. The screenplay does not tap into its full potential but I was still attached to the screen through the whole runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will slightly touch on O’Connor and what he does from the director’s chair. I was disappointed in the performances he gets out of his cast which disappoints after a film like &lt;em&gt;Warrior&lt;/em&gt;. I think he shows flashes of brilliance when it comes to storytelling but nowhere near enough for me to remember any of it by next year. I do love how the film skips over an obvious connective conversation and gets straight to the next scene because it is common sense what will happen. It shows that O’Connor trusts the audience to use their brains, which I love. The cinematography and technical elements are decent which pretty much sums up how I feel about what O’Connor brings to this film. So &lt;em&gt;The Way Back&lt;/em&gt; is far from the next master class from Gavin O’Connor and Ben Affleck, but it is still a fun watch. A heartfelt story with a great message and a beautiful performance from Affleck at the heart of it. If you have the free time, check this one out.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/2020/03/2020-03-06-my-hero-academia-heroes-rising-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;My Hero Academia: Heroes Rising does a magnificent job at appealing to its established anime fan base as well as quickly introducing the rich world to new audiences like myself who are not familiar with this highly-acclaimed show. In fact, the film may persuade new viewers to go and explore the world further by tuning into the anime, which is currently on its 4th season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_A-6qcgExA4&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the population has a single power that all the characters refer to as a Quirk. Justin Briner voices protagonist Izuku and he, along with his fellow high school friends, are tasked with training on the seemingly peaceful Nabu island. Unbeknownst to them, a tyrannically powerful villain who can possess multiple quirks aims to steal a native young boy’s quirk needed to carry out a sinister plan and is willing to destroy anyone that attempts to protect him. Our heroes must rise up, team up, and make some difficult decisions in order to overcome his menacing presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Izuku is an extremely likable protagonist because of his desire to save, help, and put others above his own needs and that allowed me to root for his desire to protect two children, who you also become quite fond of. This is an action-filled anime with extremely long battles but what makes these sequences work is not only how epic they feel, but because of the heart and motive behind the fights that are taking place. You understand why the villain chooses to wreak havoc, as he will literally die without obtaining the child’s ability. Therefore, there is meaning behind each punch and every power seen on screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If elongated action scenes don’t turn you on, skip Heroes Rising because that is a large portion of the film but if you can get behind the heart of our heroes you will have a fun time watching them take on this impressively sinister force, whose actions also feel realistic and threatening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is easily predictable and the film would have been more interesting if it had more surprises, but instead the ending plays out quite conventionally. Also, numerous supporting characters take up several beginning action scenes and their battles weren’t nearly as interesting as the rest that proceed as we hardly know anything about who these other people are. Nevertheless, it would’ve been impossible to showcase who everyone is due to time and viewers of the anime will surely have more admiration for the minor characters. Still, as someone who has not seen the anime, I was engaged with the lead characters that it does develop superbly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: I saw the English Dubbed version of this film in 4DX and enjoyed the voice acting and special effects included in the 4DX experience. The lightening was captilized by white strobe lights around the screen and fans blew a pleasant wind during flying or tornado/gust scenes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Prior to the film’s release and before viewing the film myself, I had the opportunity to interview three Onward production members who are from Houston, Texas! The interviews took place with the following creatives on three separate dates and their answers to various interview questions have been compiled within this editorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixar Production Members&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dana Frankoff, Production Coordinator (7 Years at Pixar)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Jacy Johnson, Production Coordinator  (5 Years at Pixar)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Christine Crowley, Script / Edit Coordinator (3.5 Years at Pixar)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dana was asked about what she misses the most and least about Houston and how she spends her time when she’s here…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dana:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t really miss the heat! I really miss my family…and the Tex Mex food. They don’t have Mexican food like that anywhere else. My family has moved to the museum district since the flooding a few years ago. We used to live in Meyerland. When I go back I spend most my time at restaurants in Montrose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;text-align:center;font-size:small;color:#003366;background:#D6EAF8;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2020/03/Dana_Frankoff.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dana Frankoff&quot; title=&quot;Dana Frankoff&quot; style=&quot;max-height:35vh;vertical-align:middle;padding:5px 5px 2px 5px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dana Frankoff, Production Coordinator&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Houstonians would agree we could see less humid heat but do appreciate our style of Mexican food! The conversation then progressed to &lt;em&gt;Onward&lt;/em&gt;. I wanted to know what makes &lt;em&gt;Onward&lt;/em&gt; special and why general audiences should go see it. Production members talked about the film being emotional, deep, and comedic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jacy:&lt;/strong&gt; It was special to see two boys be emotionally vulnerable with each other — to see their relationship grow. I’ve not seen something like it before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;text-align:center;font-size:small;color:#003366;background:#D6EAF8;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2020/03/JacyJohnson.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jacy Johnson&quot; title=&quot;Jacy Johnson&quot; style=&quot;max-height:35vh;vertical-align:middle;padding:5px 5px 2px 5px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jacy Johnson, Production Coordinator&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dana:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Onward&lt;/em&gt; is a special film about brotherhood/siblinghood and how working together gets you further than being selfish. It also touches upon, I think, how the further we get into technology the further we can get away from the “magic” inside of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dana shared how she thought about this film on a personal level…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dana:&lt;/strong&gt; My mom passed away when I was 10 and I often wonder what it would be like if I could bring her back for one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixar is not shy from relating its characters and stories to deep relevant messages. After seeing the film, I can concur that the story is excitingly sentimental and is so in a special realistic manner that is not predictable or cliché. Additionally, Christine shares how the quality of production allows the film to be not only heartfelt, but hilarious as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christine:&lt;/strong&gt; The voice talent is amazing. There are so many hilarious moments and it truly is one of those movies where you’ll laugh and cry. I’ve seen it thousands of times at this point and I am still moved by the story. It’s just a wonderful family film…about relationships and loved ones and what you do for those people and what they mean to you. It’s nice because it feels like a film that anyone of any age, whether you have siblings or not, can really access, understand, and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2020/03/OnwardArticle1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ian and Barley&quot; title=&quot;Ian and Barley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christine went on to mention how this project was special to her and what aspect of her role she enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christine:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the first role at Pixar where I’ve got to travel for it and got to meet the talent and just spend a little more one-on-one time with the producer/director and show leadership…that was really special and rewarding for me. I feel like I got to be a part of the center of what this movie ended up being. We just haven’t made a movie like this before. I loved Cars 3. I loved Incredibles 2. I wanted to work on both of those films. I think they were wonderful. I think this is the first original Pixar film that I’ve worked on. So there’s something special about that as well because it’s a new story and everyone’s starting from ground zero on what they want those characters and that story to be. In the other films, we came in, we knew who the characters were, and we were telling a new story within those worlds. But this is a new world. These are new characters so it’s just a different feeling to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;text-align:center;font-size:small;color:#003366;background:#D6EAF8;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2020/03/ChristineCrowley1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Christine Crowley&quot; title=&quot;Christine Crowley&quot; style=&quot;max-height:35vh;vertical-align:middle;padding:5px 5px 2px 5px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Christine Crowley, Script Coordinator&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is delightful to see fresh characters and interesting how the creation process is also special for production members. While each Pixar film has something special about it, I wanted to know what were the greatest challenges that had to be overcome in order to make this flick truly special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dana:&lt;/strong&gt; The biggest challenge is that in production you have to be on top of the latest information in regards to what’s going on in the film at all times. That is always changing; …you have to provide that information for the artist on scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dana needs to relay information to artists and so knowing the most recent information from various production crew will assist her with correctly assigning artists tasks so they can know what they should be focused on and/or revise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jacy:&lt;/strong&gt; Animation is the part of the pipeline I know the least about. I studied the animation pipeline in school, but I didn’t specifically study the craft of animation…the software that they [the animators] were using is very sophisticated and complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As complicated as animation can look to those who have not had expeirence with it, be comforted that Production Coordinators may too have a learning curve to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2020/03/OnwardArticle4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ian and Barley&quot; title=&quot;Ian and Barley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will come as no surprise to discover that scripts are re-written and Christine sheds light on how she has seen a script evolve over time and how she quite admires early conversations that define the story. It is interesting to note that the script can change hundreds of times to get the film to a point that feels complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christine:&lt;/strong&gt;  One of the best parts of being on the film would be being in the room when they are having those creative story-based conversations to decide what the movie is going to be…ultimately the director gets to choose what happens, but it is a collaborative spirit. Depending on who’s in the room you don’t even need to be a lead and can give your input….it [the script] gets tossed back and forth…it’s our job to keep track of that and…people see it at various stages…and then we look at it in editorial and then we’ll get new ideas for things we want to try. There are many, many versions of it. Often times I join the show and there’s a hundred scenes that have been deleted, re-written, and  taken out of the movie…Sometimes it’s just a line here and there that gets changed, or we really want to focus on a character and making that story arc stronger. It varies why we rewrite things, but overall the movie from the time that it’s an idea that gets pitched to the time it comes out- there are hundreds of versions of the script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2020/03/OnwardArticle6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Onward Banner&quot; title=&quot;Onward Banner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacy talked about how she became involved with &lt;em&gt;Onward&lt;/em&gt;, how many production members the animation department and she interacts with, and what she enjoys about her workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jacy:&lt;/strong&gt; The story itself had a lot of heart. That’s what really appealed to me and when we were deciding what film I would work on next, I requested to work on it and I requested to work specifically in the animation department, because it was an experience I hadn’t had before. The animation department specifically is a very big group. I think we had at least 100 animators at one point…we would interact with the editorial department, the art department, simulation, effects, and characters because it’s so collaborative and everyone affects everyone…What was really cool about working in the animation department- they were finding the characters as they were beginning to animate them. Everything changes when you start to animate and you find the characters along that way of that pipeline. This is a special place where they really come alive and defining the way that they move has a lot with who those characters are…I learned so much about physicality and what physicality means emotionally and how that connects your viewers and how that can define a character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you get past the technical learning curve that animation has, there is much to learn about the specific way in which characters are animated that affects the perceptions of that character. It is refreshing that people working in the industry are still learning, growing, and can give hope to those who maybe one day want to work at Pixar depite the hurdles they feel they might have to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2020/03/OnwardArticle5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ian and Barley&quot; title=&quot;Ian and Barley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have ever thought about pursuing a career in animation, Dana and Jacy were specifically asked about the advice they might have for those interested in this career field. Specifically, Dana was asked if a student living in Houston (or anywhere that isn’t LA) should go to a specific college or animation program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dana:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s a really good question because animation is very specific to LA and…in the Bay Area. I don’t know what’s going on in Houston– I’m sure there are smaller projects. Austin is growing in the film scene; I haven’t heard much about animated studios but keep your passionate eye on where you can get the best education…I never thought of A&amp;amp;M as a college with an animated program that would get you into the film business but there are a good amount of people here [at Pixar] who have attended A&amp;amp;M. Go to those schools where you know you are going to get the best education…I knew I wanted to be in one specific place and I kept my eye on that goal. I even had a recruiter from Pixar tell me that I was an example of someone who didn’t give up…I applied here four times before I got a job. Don’t get discouraged and know what you want!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jacy:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep going! There’s a lot of frustration with a creative career and a creative life…A lot of people will tell you no, but you have to…push past that, keep trying, and keep learning. Don’t be scared of failing– we are all going to fail and that’s just part of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2020/03/OnwardArticle3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Onward&quot; title=&quot;Onward&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adversity appears to be a common thread people have experienced in their reach to land a position at an Animated studio but the best advice is to persist and to not be discouraged by rejection. Dana explains why Pixar is the animated studio she considers home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dana:&lt;/strong&gt; The culture in a company is always very different. That is something you should keep in mind when you graduate and know where you want to be. I found my career home here at Pixar because I feel like the mentality here is very fitting to what I was looking for and a very encouraging environment. They honor the life-work balance a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacy shares her journey on becoming a part of the Pixar team…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jacy:&lt;/strong&gt; I went to Texas A&amp;amp;M. I have a Bachelor’s degree in Visualization, which is the study of computer science and fine arts- where those two disciplines overlap. I studied the technical side and the art side. I focused on making films, and I ended up learning how to manage those kind of projects. I found that Pixar offers these internships for production management one year and I thought the job description suited the skills that I have. I applied and came out here my last year of college and was hired from there as a PA (Production Assistant) and eventually became a production coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2020/03/OnwardArticle2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ian and Barley&quot; title=&quot;Ian and Barley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a pleasure to speak with Jacy, Christine, and Dana. We were able to learn how three talented individuals from our area have bursted out of their hometown bubble to be able to work in a competitively rewarding Animation studio. Additionally, we were able to learn the best aspects and most challenging working components on Pixar’s upcoming quest, &lt;em&gt;Onward&lt;/em&gt;. Go see this film this upcoming weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/2020/03/2020-03-03-the-invisible-man-a-second-opinion.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Invisible Man&lt;/em&gt; starts with a lot of promise before beginning to consistently disappoint and punish those who watch it, much like the abusive partner it attempts to portray. Cheap writing, lazy plot construction, careless disregard for details, and downright silly action sequences bludgeon every last drop of potential from the original premise and creative camera work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dSBsNeYqh-k&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creeping out of her home in the middle of the night, Cecilia (Elizabeth Moss), attempts to escape her abusive husband. After carefully fleeing into the woods she manages to narrowly escape a level of domestic abuse that is never specifically defined. After escaping, Cecilia takes refuge with her friend James (Aldis Hodge) and his daughter. Shortly after beginning her new life she is informed of her husband’s death. After receiving a substantial inheritance she tries to move on despite being haunted by increasingly escalating attempts to sabotage her life and destroy her supporting relationships which she believes to be her husband, still alive and using technology to make himself invisible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Elizabeth Moss may play an emotionally and physically abused woman, the real victim here is the outstanding premise. The switch in perspective from a man driven mad with power to a woman suffering from the lingering trauma that continues to haunt her even after she has escaped is brilliant. One of the things that director Leigh Whannell does exceptionally well here is to use the camera to capture the perspective of PTSD… using focus and perspective to constantly leave the audience with the expectation of a haunting presence on the edge of every screen or in every empty chair or hallway. The metaphor is brilliant and haunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tragically, however, every other aspect of the film is shallow and cheap. If I had to pick a single sin as the core problem with the execution, it’s that &lt;em&gt;The Invisible Man&lt;/em&gt; completely fails to make you feel any weight or physicality to its title character either visually or in the story. Characters flail wildly against empty air, their fists never connecting with a character we’re supposed to believe is there unless they’re holding a plate that’s able to break. The invisible man moves through rooms like a poltergeist, with no grounded sense that the director has any idea where the character is within the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This complete failure to evoke a sense of presence from the invisible man carries over to the dialog and plot. Characters turn on a dime and abandon Elizabeth Moss’ character at the least provocation. Situations in which her antagonist attacks or sabotages her are so poorly considered that they transition into comedy. The bizarrely surreal environment of superficially supportive friends and the cartoonishly evil antagonist is reminiscent of a Lifetime movie. The cumulative effect is a surface deep story that lacks the substance to back up its more powerful ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, these are the two areas that are the most essential to making the movie work. I found myself laughing out loud during moments that were clearly intended to feel tense or emotional. They fail to make you believe that the invisible man is truly there either emotionally or physically. The lazy writing compounds with the ridiculous special effects to produce a film that will have you screaming with frustration at the characters on screen. This could have been something great, and it hurts so much to see such a fantastic premise wasted on what we got instead.&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/2020/03/2020-03-01-the-invisible-man-2020.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;The Invisible Man is directed by SAW franchise creator, Leigh Whannel, and is suspensefully  thrilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Moss plays a woman named Cecelia who claims her abusive ex-husband, who has been reported dead, is trying to kill her. Is she crazy or is there someone invisible who is actually haunting her?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrative pleasantly surprised me as the film goes bonkers at the end of the second act and keeps the heightened tension through a series of twists and turns till the very end. This is a film that banks on a good performance and Moss delivers energy and realistic terror in each scene she’s in. Aldis Hodge and Storm Reid  play a father and daughter who are friends with Cecelia and add some intriguing drama. The beginning’s pacing is a bit slow, as we see Moss walking around as the filmmakers play with our expectations. Overall, The Invisible Man delivers strong performances and an engaging plot full of twists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom Holland and Chris Prat voice elf brothers Ian and Barley who discover a magical staff that will bring their dad back to life…but for only 24 hours. Unfortunately, the brothers only manage to bring back the father’s legs! It’s a race against time as the Dungeons and Dragons inspired quest takes the duo through a countless number of heartfelt and comedic turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Onward&lt;/em&gt; has fantastic fleshed out characters who have distinct likable personalities. Comedy is cleverly written; specifically, Octavia Spencer who plays a loud, rambunctious, and hilariously entertaining character called the Manticore. Ian satisfyingly learns a few things he never thought he could do along the journey and the climax is rewarding to see him put everything we’ve seen him learn to use. This plot has surprises, subverts your expectations, and will not end the way you think it will. The D&amp;amp;D atmosphere has a gorgeously unique style that will be adored by role-playing game fans as well as general audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/2020/02/2020-02-20-the-call-of-the-wild-2020.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;For a generally competently made film, I just don’t see why &lt;em&gt;Call of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; exists in 2020. All of the major flaws with the film are due to the source material, so they don’t feel fair to hold against the film. Unfortunately, though, if you ignore them then what’s left lacks any compelling positives. The only thing that justifies its existence is in how director Chris Sanders composes the film to feel like a cartoon. I could easily imagine each and every shot in the classic 2d style of an 80s animated feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5P8R2zAhEwg&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buck, a larger than life dog, is living the life at his large urban home with a family who loves him despite his unrestrained nature. One day he’s captured by thieves who want to sell him off in the wilds of Alaska, shipping him up north to be sold off to a sledding team. After being purchased, Buck discovers the voice of the wilderness calling out from inside him and beckoning him to live the life he was born to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the themes are dated and the action is cliche at best, these issues are not meaningful criticisms. Jack London’s &lt;em&gt;Call of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; has been adapted so many times from as far back as the early roots of cinema that it is responsible for helping create the very standards that feel antiquated. A more valid critique would be to call out how the story structure struggles to maintain an engaging pace. Plot threads are left trailing in and out of the story in ways that break the tension while trying to establish the setting and location as the film shifts from narrative to action sequences that feel out of place in the story they’re trying to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is a film that lacks tonal consistency, which highlights the stilted pacing which doesn’t know when to move the story forward vs. when to let us breathe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the flaws with structure and plot, there’s a lot that &lt;em&gt;Call of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; gets right. Chris Sanders uses compeling imagery to engage with audience. Scenes of the aurora borealis, the Alaskan wilderness, and the beautiful shifting seasons of the outdoors are moving to receptive viewers despite the heavily animated feel of the environment. Though the acting wasn’t as solid as I’d like, it’s never distractingly bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of those films where I hate to be overly negative because I reasonably enjoyed it. For all of my minor gripes, the biggest crime of &lt;em&gt;Call of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; is simply being completely forgettable. It’s a shame, because I believe that there’s a reason why this book keeps getting remade and I feel like whatever that is has been completely lost in translation.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/2020/02/2020-02-18-emma-2020.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emma.&lt;/em&gt; (with a period at the end) is an incredibly beautiful looking film. I can do nothing but praise &lt;em&gt;Emma.’s&lt;/em&gt; gorgeous Cinematography (Christopher Blauvelt), Production Design (Kave Quinn), and Costume Design (Alexandra Byrne). All three of these elements allowed me to feel like I was walking into the 1800’s. The colors are vibrantly color-graded and the costumes reflect the time and fit each character’s persona. Additionally, the acting is commendable. Unfortunately, the story is clunkily dull due to the large amounts of interactions our main characters have with the vast amounts of different underdeveloped supporting characters you know virtually nothing interesting about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qsOwj0PR5Sk&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the 1800s. Emma Woodhouse (Anya Taylor-Joy) loves to bring couples together, as the film begins with the wedding of Mr. Weston and Miss Taylor, which Emma takes joyful credit for their love developing. The rest of the film is an assortment of different characters, notably Emma’s best friend Harriet Smith (Mia Goth) and Emma’s older friend/critic George Knightly (Johnny Flynn), trying to figure out who is attracted to who. These characters are loaded with snarky one-liner comments used for comedic effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The characters Emma and Harriet did have an intriguingly dynamic friendship. Harriet is not confident with making decisions and can’t even decide on something as pivotal as accepting a marriage proposal. Harriet takes every word that comes out of Emma’s mouth as gospel truth and Emma’s input ends up causing an unpleasant domino effect. This dynamic is interesting because most people, despite however uncertain they may feel, would be able to muster up the strength to make such a big decision on their own. Not Harriet. She is one of the few characters I truly sympathized with, as she is allowing someone else to steer her life for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, after thirty minutes into the film, &lt;em&gt;Emma&lt;/em&gt; becomes clogged with side plots and drawn-out dialogue that made it difficult for me to stay interested in the narrative. It is noticeable that director Autumn de Wilde wanted to be faithful to the novel, as so many specific scenarios are crammed without giving the characters all the moments they needed to be intricate, fleshed out, or cared for. However, if you are familiar with the source material, &lt;em&gt;Emma.&lt;/em&gt; may be an enjoyable film because the novel has the luxury of being able to take its time with setting up the vast cast of characters. Therefore, what they say and the mundane situations they are in may have more meaning to an audience who already cares about the characters before entering the theater. Emma’s father (Mr. Woodhouse), Frank Churchill, Jane, Robert Martin, the Westons, and the Eltons all have a role that collides in the narrative that simply felt way too “clunky” and overall unengaging due to the lack of time the film is able to spend on all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/2020/02/2020-02-13-the-photograph-2020.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;For the better part of my life, the movies set for Valentine’s Day have been some of the most mediocre films to come out that year. Romance movies don’t really appeal to me, as most are formulaic and don’t really take any chances. The past two years have given us &lt;em&gt;Fifty Shades Freed&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Isn’t It Romantic&lt;/em&gt; and so on the surface, this year would be following suit. However, in 2020 do we have a black-led Valentine’s Day movie that is actually…good?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Photograph&lt;/em&gt; is written and directed by Stella Meghie, starring Issa Rae and LaKeith Stanfield. It tells the story of Michael Block (Stanfield) who is researching a story about Christine (Chanté Adams), which leads him to meet her daughter Mae (Rae). The two have a spark but, with Michael unsure about his own life, the two deal with the repercussions of falling for each other&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie is as feel-good as it gets. Stanfield and Rae have amazing chemistry and it exudes off the screen throughout the whole runtime. We get small cameos from famed comedian Lil Rel who delivers amazing comedic relief. Away from Lil Rel’s character, the film is hilarious and had me laughing the whole time. With the main story between Michael and Mae, we cut back to Christine back in the ’80s dealing with her boyfriend at the time, Issac (Y’Lan Noel). The storyline has entertaining dramatic moments, but there’s a few major plot holes that did bother me and prevented me from being entirely invested in the plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director/writer Stella Meghie is the standout of the film. Her direction is very subtle and not over-stylized. This means that the performances and story have to do the heavy lifting (which is rare at times in Hollywood today). Speaking of the script, Meghie pens one of the better romance movies I have seen in the past few years. The movie goes by so fast, as I was never bored and the film is always moving (no fat slow/boring parts). I don’t think it’s perfect as I feel having to switch between two relationships throughout the entire movie doesn’t give enough time to fully develop either storyline. Both suffer because of this, especially our main storyline with Michael and Mae. However, it is far from terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, &lt;em&gt;The Photograph&lt;/em&gt; is the perfect Valentine’s Day movie. Great all together effort put forth from Issa Rae, LaKeith Stanfield and all brought together by Stella Meghie. This is one you want to take your significant other to!&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/2020/02/2020-02-13-sonic-the-hedgehog-2020.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Jeff Fowler directs &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt;, a film based on the 90s Sega video games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film centers around this typically optimistic blue hedgehog who becomes depressed when thinking that he will always be alone– him and I sure do have that in common- except this dude’s strong emotions causes a city-wide power outage. Jim Carrey plays a silly sinister over-the-top Dr. Robotnik who is hired by the government to discover and eliminate the cause of the blackout. Sonic teams up with Sheriff Tom Wachowski, played by James Marsden, in order to prevent being caught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setup interestingly sheds light on Sonic’s origins and I could sympathize to Sonic feeling lonely! Unfortunately, outside of the setup which was well-developed, the film becomes predictable and formulaic as soon as Carrey hits the screen. Children may find his lines to be comical but I found most of them to be outlandishly unclever (which is unfortunate, as I am a fan of Carrey’s classics, such as &lt;em&gt;The Mask&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Liar Liar&lt;/em&gt;). I do not think you need to run out to see &lt;em&gt;Sonic&lt;/em&gt; this weekend, but it is fine passive entertainment kids will enjoy, 90s adults may be amused by.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/2020/02/2020-02-06-birds-of-prey-and-the-fantabulous-emancipation-of-one-harley-quinn-2020.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Despite being average in quality and execution, I am absolutely in love with &lt;em&gt;The Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn&lt;/em&gt;. The energy of the film captures the feeling of Harley Quinn while building action scenes that evoke her personality. While &lt;em&gt;Birds of Prey&lt;/em&gt; isn’t for everyone, director Cathy Yan has pulled the trigger on a film that is specifically for fans of this unique villain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/x3HbbzHK5Mc&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though heartbroken, Harleen Quinzel (aka Harley Quinn) is left to her own devices after a sudden break up with The Joker. The emancipated Quinn finds herself isolated in a world filled with an unlimited list of violent characters with grudges against her and a metaphorical axe over her head. Tormented by misogynists, victims of her untargeted crimes, and the police, Harley begins a race against the clock to recover a stolen diamond before her own time runs out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birds of Prey&lt;/em&gt; is abrasive right from the start. The character introductions are abrupt and mixed up in a narrative that jumps back and forth with ADD riddled glee. Floating from one plot point to the next, grasping onto a subject for as long as her damaged attention span can hold on, the story lives and breathes with Harley’s perspective. Even when the characters are shallow, narrative threads are lost, or the editing loses track of the action, it works in favor of making the movie feel like the embodiment of Harley Quinn’s personality. It’s delightful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the electric momentum of the film, its strong feminist politics will put off some viewers. This is a comic film, so it’s forgivable that the level of misogyny is downright cartoonish in service of allowing the viewer to indulge in Harley’s violent antics. It’s just easier when her outbursts feel a bit justified. Just be warned that the film has a clear, aggressive perspective that won’t work for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just can’t close out without calling out the performances in &lt;em&gt;Birds of Prey&lt;/em&gt;. Margot Robbie simply gets Harley Quinn. She brings the character to life with mannerisms that I cannot imagine her without. Ewan McGreggor is gleeful in his portrayal of a woman-hating Black Mask. Honestly, everyone is on point, but what I loved more than the performances was the collection of characters that I didn’t think I would ever see on screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black Mask, detective Montoya, Zsasz, Black Canary, and The Huntress… it’s like a police line-up of some of the characters that I have always wanted to see included in a blockbuster movie. It just fills me with hope to know that more and more of the little bits that I loved about comics have hope of making it on screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I loved it. I had a blast and I enjoyed myself from beginning to end. If you ever loved Harley Quinn as a character, then this movie is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

Mark Burnell wrote the screenplay as well as the book and he should probably stick to books because his screenplay is tremendously dull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blake Lively plays Stephanie Patrick, a woman who is trying to figure out who is responsible for the airplane crash that results in her parent’s death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yF4KFWpq2TI&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;John Wick&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Death Wish&lt;/em&gt;, and even &lt;em&gt;Peppermint&lt;/em&gt; were more entertaining revenge films. The main issue with &lt;em&gt;The Rhythm Section&lt;/em&gt; is that it does not get the audience to care for Stephanie or her family– the only time we ever see them is through silent flashbacks. Therefore, the protagonist’s motivation for revenge feels fake. In addition, the action is depressingly lazy and you can tell they did the bare minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/2020/01/2020-01-24-the-turning-2020.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Turning&lt;/em&gt; will have horror fans turning their brains off because this film has no plot after the short setup. Instead, it is meaninglessly creepy with no answers until the very end and the final answer isn’t a great payout either as it’s vague and underwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After playing a Terminator in &lt;em&gt;Dark Fate&lt;/em&gt;, Makenzie Davis plays a pushover nanny named Kate to orphans played by &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;’ Finn Wolfhard and &lt;em&gt;Florida Projects&lt;/em&gt;’ Brooklyn Prince.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only compliment I can give &lt;em&gt;The Turning&lt;/em&gt; is the acting– Finn Wolfhard is always a pleasure to see and he plays a poop bag kid who is creepy, cruel, and defies authority entertainingly well. Makenzie Davis has a charm as a caring nanny and her and Wolfhard’s performances elevated this from being an F.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film wastes so much time on eerie vibes that copy so many horror cliches we’ve all seen; from the mirror scare, to fake dreams, and a pool drowning scene- this January cash grab is not worth a full priced ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/2020/01/2020-01-24-the-gentlemen-2020.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gentlemen&lt;/em&gt; is an unrepentant delight to consume, almost to a fault as it sacrifices weight for pleasure. While Guy Ritchie could have reached for something a little more, the giddy energy here will have you alternating between holding your breath and giggling with joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/KlXsguV9g0E&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We follow Mickey Pearson, a ruthless American businessman who has set up an unrivaled weed empire in the UK. Having reached a healthy age and being somewhat satisfied with his current wealth he has begun to lose his appetite for violence and mayhem. As the walls close in around his empire just as he’s trying to move on to his next great adventure, we follow along with the brutal entanglements of criminal endeavors seasoned with distinct regional flare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing Guy Ritchie not just return to form but also evolve his style is a welcome surprise. As a director who has been more hit than miss since he burst onto the scene with &lt;em&gt;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&lt;/em&gt; followed immediately by &lt;em&gt;Snatch&lt;/em&gt;, two movies that promised a unique voice in cinema that Ritchie has not been delivering on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;em&gt;The Gentlemen&lt;/em&gt; feels like a version of &lt;em&gt;Snatch&lt;/em&gt; that achieves a stronger narrative voice while pulling the viewer into a more tightly woven plot. It’s an evolution in style that reminds me of why I look forward to his movies. More than that, he works in absolute concert with a phenomenal cast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew McConaughey is a machine. He never turns off, every scene in every movie and TV show he is in he brings everything there is to give. Is he even human? Colin Farrell is a creative voice who takes risks with his character. Hugh Grant is more entertaining than he’s been in years. Henry Golding blends bite with class. Michelle Dockery doesn’t have nearly enough scenes given how chilling she is. Even Charlie Hunnam acts, probably more than I’ve ever seen before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only disappointment was that Guy Ritchie pulls some punches along the way. I’d like to say that it holds &lt;em&gt;The Gentelmen&lt;/em&gt; back from being a classic, but the reality is that the mix of energetic flavors delivers a film without peer. I just wish that it had been more perfect, and that feels trite when I say it out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/2020/01/2020-01-23-assassin-33-a-d-2020.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin 33 A.D.&lt;/em&gt; is opening in limited release this weekend and may be worth a trip to the movies if you’re a fan of faith based films and are prepared to have fun with a SciFi premise that is uniquely interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XFnVZnrFWdo&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ram (Morgan Roberts), Simon (Lamar Usher), Amy (Ilsa Levine), and Felix (Cesar D’ La Torre) are scientists who stumble upon a way to go back in time. Unfortunately, the humans that they work for have the sinister intention of going back in time to kill Jesus before his resurrection. Our protagonists learn of these motives, travel to 33 A.D., struggle with their faith, and learn from each other in this action-packed adventure that might have you on board if you are the audience member it is targetting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin 33 A.D.’s&lt;/em&gt; target audience is Christians who also enjoy SciFi and care to see a plot that weaves their faith into a thrilling story (and I happen to fall right into that target audience!). When I first heard the premise, my interest was piqued because the film would explore something I already deeply care about (my faith) in a fresh way I had not seen before. Seeing characters who are people from our present world have the opportunity to go back in time and interact with history I am already familiar with was a fun idea. However, if you are not a person who has an emotional investment in the Christian faith or hearing the story’s premise doesn’t catch your interest, this movie will not win you over. You will have to already be sold out to the idea that Jesus is vital and be concerned from the moment you press play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot has an undeniable comparison to &lt;em&gt;The Terminator&lt;/em&gt; (someone sent back in time to kill someone important) and the film acknowledges this as Jesus tells a present day character named Simon, “I’ll be back,” and Simon replies, “That’s not your movie!” Additionally, time traveling can become a bit convoluted. Does this surprise anyone? “Slow that down and say that again,” Simon tells Ram because the time continuum is not the easiest concept to follow. However, this film does not bank on the time traveling plot being easily understood but, instead, hopes to engage you with its characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best aspect of &lt;em&gt;Assassin 33 A.D.&lt;/em&gt; is the motivations of its characters. No one is just a “bad guy” as the film takes time to interestingly give every person a reason for doing what it is that they do. A surprising opening and a violent flash back clearly show (not simply tell) the audience why certain characters want to stop Jesus and despite the audience not wanting these characters to be successful, we can clearly understand why they want to do what they do. Additionally, each character has distinct characteristics that make each of them unique and are, overall, an interesting group dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the story is a bit hokey, relies on a suspension of disbelief (like any SciFi probably might), and wants you to care about its characters more than you actually do. There’s so many instances a character loses everything that is important to him or her. From parents being murdered (twice) and a family dying in a car accident you may start to get the feeling that so much of the plot is noticeably contrived instead of feeling like all of this could happen naturally, which distracted me from getting emotionally invested. Instead, it does feel like my heart strings were trying to be manipulated. Despite this, you can tell writer and director Jim Carroll cared deeply about this story and its characters. Lots of thoughts were put into why each character was doing what they were doing and because it was all clearly communicated amongst scenarios that were naturally intriguing, it was enough to be entertained for 1 hour and 49 minutes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Disclaimer: Compensition was recieved in order to prioritize this review (but not influence the review), as the film was received a few days before its opening weekend. Furthurmore, all parties involved with EskimoTV are committed to being sincere in their reviews and also transparent about any exchange that could be percieved as an ulterior motive for publishing a review.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/2020/01/2020-01-15-weathering-with-you-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Directed by Makoto Shinkai, Weathering With You is a japanese animated film I would highly recommend for audiences who want to see a compelling love story told through breathtaking anime visuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you get past reading subtitles, the story becomes very interesting as our high school protagonist runs away from home and meets a girl who can control the weather and oh boy do I sure wish she could rid Texas humidity. The duo utilize her abilities to launch a business where people can pay to have perfect weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film uses this fantasy premise to uniquely show these characters becoming close to each other and I genuinely loved the relationship that they shared and the surprises that are eventually revealed. The pacing is a bit slow in the third act and that is largely due to some scenes feeling repetitive and similar to one another. Nevertheless, the final act practically had me in tears. Despite this film being animated, it is rated PG-13 for violence and language. The story, the visuals, and music all make this a film I can confidently recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/2020/01/2020-01-15-bad-boys-for-life-2020.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bad Boys for Life&lt;/em&gt; is a hilarious, action-packed thriller that will leave you so entertained that you might miss that you’re rooting for a villain. Directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah do an excellent job of capturing Michael Bay’s style, but their film flirts with a redemptive arc that would have our heroes overcome the toxic traits that keep them from growing as characters only to double down and dive deeper into their monstrosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jKCj3XuPG8M&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rejoin detectives Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) in their sunset years as officers with decorated careers just as Marcus Burnett is becoming a grandfather. The change in his reality causes him to question the need to regularly put his life in harm’s way and he challenges his long-time partner to a race to determine whether or not they retire together. Before the race is complete, Mike Lowrey is gunned down in the street by a masked assailant. Once recovered, Mike is driven from the shame of being victimized to hunt down his attacker for revenge against the advice and better judgment of everyone who loves him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before touching on the things that bothered me, I want to give &lt;em&gt;Bad Boys for Life&lt;/em&gt; a lot of praise. It’s a breath of fresh air in the action-adventure genre. Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah have brought back a little piece of the mid-90s in a way that feels freshly inviting. The cast has charisma, the dialog is charming, and the action is so loud and dumb that you have to enjoy it for the theater that it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will Smith turns in his best beginning to end performance since &lt;em&gt;Collateral Beauty&lt;/em&gt; in 2016. I felt his emasculating shame and his drive to punch everything better.  Even Martin Lawrence is so on point that I thoroughly enjoyed his performance from beginning to end and he is an actor I struggle to appreciate. While these performances were front and center, there wasn’t a single weak link in the entire cast and directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah managed to bring the best out of everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quality with which this naked indulgence is delivered must be seen to be appreciated. I just wish it had something better to say, or… hell… that it said less.  The driving action of the film is Mike Lowrey’s need for revenge at the expense of justice, personal relationships, and happiness. This toxic inability to move on with his life and change as a person is the core of the plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The directors toy with calling Mike’s character out on his damage once or twice in the film. The moments where the story clearly highlights how his character allows it to hurt everyone he loves are some of the best points we get to experience. Unfortunately, those moments are twisted to double down on the validation of the worst traits of the character. Any moment of introspection is inverted before being repurposed to spell out the theme: when you’re mad, take it out on the people who caused that anger at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I couldn’t get past that message. Maybe it wouldn’t have bothered me so much if they’d left out the character growth entirely. I know this is an action flick, I am familiar with its heritage and what it’s supposed to be. But it’s not 1995 anymore. In some ways, I don’t think it ever really was. We have seen action done right. We’ve seen how all of the best parts of how these characters make us feel can be achieved with growth and value. We’ve seen that you can blow up every single set and do it with a narrative that advocates doing the right thing and getting over your pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll undoubtedly enjoy &lt;em&gt;Bad Boys for Life&lt;/em&gt;, it’s a genuine blast. But try not to forget that you’re watching the thrashings of a violent man child. Please see the chaos that follows the character like a cancer and poisons everything he touches.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/2020/01/2020-01-09-like-a-boss-2020.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Though humorous, &lt;em&gt;Like a Boss&lt;/em&gt; lacks teeth and appears to get bored of its premise prematurely.  Worse, director Miguel Arteta even appears to reach the limits of the charm of Tiffany Haddish while having her rehash the same notes as any other generic comedy. It’s a shame to see so much promise deliver so little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ESkyRFEso4&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No lie, there is a lot of potential here. Rich comedies that explore challenging friendships appear to be a theme with Tiffany.  After &lt;em&gt;Girl’s Trip&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Tuca and Bertie&lt;/em&gt;, Tiffany Haddish plays Mia alongside Rose Byrne as Mel who have been best friends for their whole lives. Together they are living the dream by building a business together and each working with their closest friend on earth until their products catch the eye of ultra-rich Claire Luna. Claire Luna (Salma Hayek) is a ruthless makeup mogul intent on taking majority ownership of the company that Mia and Mel have built while ruining their friendship to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laughs mostly work and there’s a lot of talented acting here, everything gets resolved cheaply. The pacing runs out of steam and we’re treated to a resolution that feels cheap. No, it’s more than that, it feels lazy. The disinterest shown in giving a satisfying resolution to Mia and Mel’s story is almost palpable in the final moments. Whether because the writers were bored or disinterested, the lack of satisfying conclusion undermines any bite that &lt;em&gt;Like a Boss&lt;/em&gt; had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Haddish is always glowing, but she’s not enough to overcome the rushed storytelling. Even with such a talented supporting cast, she doesn’t have the strength to prop up the experience. Worse, the lack of freshness further highlights the feeling that Haddish is replaying the same role over again, but without life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I walked out of the theater, I just felt like my time would have been better spent re-watching &lt;em&gt;Tuca and Bertie&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not that I disliked the film, it’s just left me feeling like I’d eaten a single Pringle… unsatisfied and wanting more. While there is something to be said for leaving the audience eager for more of what you have, it doesn’t count if you leave them absolutely starving.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/12/2019-12-18-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&lt;/em&gt; director J.J. Abrams impresses me with his ability to direct a story that is told in a clear, engaging, and tight manner. There are side quests that certainly could have been cut, shortened, or altered to take up less running time. However, the overarching story is interestingly epic and gives each pivotal character a fantastic arc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/14EztMXh5vQ&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year after the events of &lt;em&gt;The Last Jedi&lt;/em&gt;, darkness continues to push Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) to rid the Jedi. Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), and the rest of the Resistance, led by General Leia (Carrie Fisher), must face off against the forces of evil in order to save those whom they love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film starts off intriguingly, wasting no time establishing character goals and motivations. From the first twenty minutes, I was highly invested in seeing what would happen to all of the characters and felt some real suspense, wondering how it would all conclude. &lt;em&gt;The Rise of Skywalker&lt;/em&gt; is a film that is communicated in such a clear manner that someone who has generally kept up with the narrative can follow along and not be bogged down by convoluted Star Wars jargon. The plot is simple, effective, and the pacing is more upbeat than some of the other films (although some fluff is still present in this 2 hour and 22 minute film).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cinematography, visual effects, and score all come together to create several beautiful vibrant eye-catching sequences that are action-packed, often epic, and even sometimes emotional. Specifically, the action scenes in &lt;em&gt;The Rise of Skywalker&lt;/em&gt; are shot and edited extremely well; from spaceship and lightsaber battles, scenes are full of high-saturated colors and are impressive. Some action sequences run too long but that is coming from someone who is not the biggest lover of elongated action scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the setup and conclusion are executed in a gripping way, there are some side quests that easily could have been cut or altered to save time and get to the point even faster. For example, our protagonists find a dagger that has an important message on it written in an unrecognizable “sith language”. Unfortunately, C3P0 is forbidden to translate it. This is an interesting situation; our droid friend has information helpful to his allies but due to the way he is programmed, he can’t fork up the translation. I wouldn’t have minded if a few minutes were spent on persuading him to translate it or the heroes themselves reprogramming C3P0. Instead, we get a fair share of time spent on our heroes having to go to a new location to find someone who can assist with the conundrum and by the end of the film, these scenes do not feel so important. While this is my “biggest” complaint with &lt;em&gt;The Rise of Skywalker&lt;/em&gt;, it is ultimately very minute, as there is a lot to love and digest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finale is epic. Everything I said of the action scenes applies to the finale; but not only are these scenes beautiful– they are poignantly unique. From strobe lighting, to the way lightsabers are used, and the way all of the special effects and sounds (and lack of) are implemented, I was in awe of how all of these elements were stitched together to finish off the climactic arc in the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of footage that Disney had of Carrie Fisher was spectacular and worked tremendously well. The manner in which Abrams and the writing team utilized her character was satisfying, fitting, and touching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Themes related to confronting fear, accepting who you are, who you are not, forgiveness, and ones’ destiny are all themes explored in &lt;em&gt;The Rise of Skywalker&lt;/em&gt;. I will not spoil any of the plot in order to explain how the themes are prevalent but I found the themes to positive ones that were implemented seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;em&gt;Episode IX&lt;/em&gt; may be my favorite film in the franchise due to the way it spectacularly grows its already-developed characters, delivers on epic action, and concludes a saga that has spanned decades.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/12/2019-12-13-jumanji-the-next-level-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Despite being wilder and more cartoonish than its predecessor, &lt;em&gt;Jumanji: The Next Level&lt;/em&gt; manages to maintain a more even tone which results in a better film. So that you know where I stand, I didn’t care for &lt;em&gt;Welcome to the Jungle&lt;/em&gt; as it went too far in ways that broke the immersion for me. Oddly, &lt;em&gt;The Next Level&lt;/em&gt; is more over the top but works better as a whole for improved consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/F6QaLsw8EWY&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the highlight is still the lead actors. Somehow &lt;em&gt;Jumanji&lt;/em&gt; as a franchise has pulled in some outstanding talent. Danny DeVito, Awkwafina, Jack Black, Danny Glover, Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, and a whole host of other outstanding performers are present. Even turning in subpar performances they’re still fun to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gag that works the best is watching Dwayne Johnson do his impression of Danny DeVito while Kevin Hart channels Danny Glover. It’s cheesy, light-hearted comedy that holds up for most of the runtime.  Outside of the shift in tone and the mixup between the characters, &lt;em&gt;The Next Level&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t change much around the formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No mistake, though, it is a formula. If you enjoy the franchise, you’ll keep getting these for as long as they’re profitable at this point. These are light on substance as well as style. The strongest statement you can make is that it’s a neutered shadow of the original &lt;em&gt;Jumanji&lt;/em&gt;. That’s a toothless critique, though, because it’s not trying to be more than that. As Jerry Holkins of Penny Arcade would phrase it, it’s like making fun of a clown for having big feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, to me it’s important. I loved the original, and as the years have gone by and the sheen has faded I’d like to see something as imaginative and emotional to take its place. I’d also like to see better work from this cast. They’re not just comedians but all outstanding actors that deserve to add something sincere. They deserve a story that has enough heart for them to put some soul into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not fair, though. That’s not this film’s fault or even its responsibility. It’s fun, lighthearted, and entertaining. There’s more important stuff out there, but this will do in a pinch. It’s funny and inoffensive.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/12/2019-12-13-j-j-is-wrong-about-the-last-jedi.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Everyone is up in arms about J.J. Abrams’ quotes about &lt;em&gt;The Last Jedi&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/movies/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-jj-abrams.html&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, happy to dredge up which side of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; they’re on these days. During his interview, J.J. allowed a moment of seeming off-handed candor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some interesting praise for Rian Johnson’s film, he followed with an afterthought. He began his world-shaking quote to &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt; with a simple, “on the other hand.” J.J. continued, “it’s a bit of a meta approach to the story. I don’t think that people go to Star Wars to be told, ‘This doesn’t matter.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a fascinating quote for several reasons. It’s a legacy director returning to the spotlight. It’s also a political film. Not in the traditional sense of politics, but this is a cornerstone film for what may be the largest media conglomeration of all time and represents some of the most meticulous construction and publicity maintenance the world has ever seen. Everyone who touches these films is vetted to an outstanding degree. It’s a rare glimpse of critique between authors working with the same medium in a way that few do. And by the medium I don’t mean film, I am referring specifically to the franchise of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; as the medium in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more shared here than tools and canvas, these authors are sharing a set of paints that only a handful of artists in all the world have touched. They’re painting with Luke Skywalker, Leia, the Rebellion, the Empire… even the force. They’re creating with the building blocks of the childhood of hundreds of millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So people care about what they have to say about each other, which they have only done a few times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, J.J. is wrong in his interpretation. Maybe there’s a deeper clarity where a more accurate phrase would have been to say that people don’t go to &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like they’re being told, “this doesn’t matter.” But he didn’t say feel. He said that this is what &lt;em&gt;The Last Jedi&lt;/em&gt; said about its subject matter, and, on that point, I believe he is simply wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a lot of the coverage of this quote focuses on how Rian Johnson resolved the questions left behind after J.J.’s &lt;em&gt;The Force Awakens&lt;/em&gt;, it would be incorrect to focus on those. They are supporting events that fit thematically with the story, but Rian was so much more overt than that. He textually stated in the film that the war doesn’t matter and that one side will win some and the other will win some but at the end of the day the real winners are the people selling the medium of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019/12/its-all-a-machine-partner-live-free-dont-join.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;It&#39;s all a machine, partner. Live free. Don&#39;t join.&quot; title=&quot;It&#39;s all a machine, partner. Live free. Don&#39;t join.&quot; /&gt;&lt;i&gt;It&#39;s all a machine, partner. Live free. Don&#39;t join.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney is selling the medium of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. At one point in time we were waiting on a slew of spin off films, TV series, games, and all of the profits of nostalgia that George Lucas had just been leaving on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re told this when Benecio Del Toro as DJ the hacker that joins Finn and Rose as they escape Canto Bight. We’re told it again when he sells them out on the &lt;em&gt;Supremacy&lt;/em&gt; before it’s destroyed. The clarity with which it is present in the text of &lt;em&gt;The Last Jedi&lt;/em&gt; is astounding. And certainly, because Rian is an excellent writer and director this theme is reflected throughout the narrative. Shockingly, he had the guts to say this out loud in one of 9 core films of arguably the most influential franchise of all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019/12/they-blow-you-up-today-you-blow-them-up-tomorrow-its-just-business.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;They blow you up today, you blow them up tomorrow. It&#39;s just business.&quot; title=&quot;They blow you up today, you blow them up tomorrow. It&#39;s just business.&quot; /&gt;&lt;i&gt;They blow you up today, you blow them up tomorrow. It&#39;s just business.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that shock, the way this seems to say that none of it matters, and the surprise at the moxy it took to express that… it’s easy to understand how someone could miss the context of the statements that Rian made in &lt;em&gt;The Last Jedi&lt;/em&gt;. These statements have to be viewed through the lens of the end of the film. Fortunately, Rian’s work is unambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the stables of Canto Bight, the force (the spirit of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;) glows in the hearts of children. We weren’t told that &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t matter. When you take the film as a whole, Rian Johnson was telling the audience that the things that make &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; special live on in spite of the bleakness surrounding it. A hundred bad, mediocre, or terrible stories couldn’t ruin what’s special about this world. That’s a gift that we’ve already been given and will always surivive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, J.J. Abrams is wrong. Maybe not about whether or not &lt;em&gt;The Last Jedi&lt;/em&gt; is any good. I don’t think that’s even important, assuming any one person could be an authority on quality. What is important is that he’s wrong about what it means. We shouldn’t be divided over which one of these pieces of corporate art we like better. Rian is right that this war will go on for as long as enough people are buying it, so we have to keep in our hearts the things that made us fall in love in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rian’s film may have been named &lt;em&gt;The Last Jedi&lt;/em&gt;, but what he gave us was a new hope.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/12/2019-12-07-marriage-story-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Get your Kleenex box for one of the best Netflix films you will see this year! In &lt;em&gt;Marriage Story&lt;/em&gt;, you can expect a heartbreaking compelling story, one of the best performances of the year (if not the best), and a genius script that held my interest from beginning to end. We get to see the great Kylo Ren and selfless Black Widow go through an emotional gut-wrenching divorce that highlights the nasty process a divorce can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BHi-a1n8t7M&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlet Johanson) have been married for years but Nicole has had enough of feeling as if she doesn’t have a voice in the relationship; it has always been what Charlie wants. While Charlie is ignorant of his selfishness (and defends the decisions he makes by believing they are in the family’s best interest), Nicole has had enough of it. Unbeknownst to her husband, she is ready to move from New York to Los Angeles with Henry (Azhy Robertson), the couple’s son, and pursue the dreams she never had the chance to pursue while with Charlie. What starts off as civil divorce negotiations turns into a terrible battlefield involving LA, New York, and a child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noah Baumbach’s screenplay is brilliant. The opening scene has both leads surprisingly explaining what they like about each other. It is rather long but it is lovely. As each character takes their turn professing the great qualities that the other has, we are treated with a well-edited montage so not only do we get to hear about why they think the other is so great, but we get to see why.  There’s a massive amount of information we learn about both characters and I quickly developed a love for both of them. This is the single joyful sequence in the entire film as Marriage Story quickly shifts gears to the couple in a counseling office, merely reminiscing on what they used to love about the other. It’s stinging to see that these people who know each other so well and have such beautiful history are ending their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam Driver and Scarlet Johanson are delivering the best performances of their careers. For the most part, they are respectful to one another and attempt to treat each other civilly throughout the nasty legal process of the divorce. However, there is “that scene” that both actors get to “go off” in an emotionally stunning argument that is interestingly strengthened by the sheer fact that you feel like you actually know who these characters are and can understand where they are coming from. My vote for best actor of 2019 is 100% Adam Driver for this role that he plays as no other performance has been as compelling. I also hope Johanson receives a nomination for her role as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The supporting cast has many compelling and/or comedic parts; Laura Dern plays a ruthless lawyer who stirs drama. Martha Kelley plays a hilariously awkward parenter monitor. Merrit Weaver shines as Nicole’s sister who is oddly nervous and fails to serve Charlie the divorce papers. Julie Hagerty plays Nicole’s mom who still wants to continue talking to Charlie, thinking highly of him (interesting dynamic there). There’s lots of really great moments from all of these actresses that really make the film come to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not going to be a feel-good romance film and so prepare yourself if you choose to see this for a dose of heavy, yet effective, melancholy reality that some truly do endure.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/11/2019-11-19-the-irishman-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure; I am not the target audience member for &lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt;. This year I have disliked almost every period piece or history movie including Judy, The King, The Lighthouse, Harriet, Tolkein, Downton Abbey, and The Highway Men (I have enjoyed Dolemite, The Report, and Ford V Ferrari). Most of these films do not appeal to me as they feature characters in situations that I can’t relate to or don’t find interesting. However, I really wanted to like &lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt;; it had a ton of buzz coming out of film festivals and had all the ingredients for it to be a successful film, including the notable director, Martin Scorsese, and an all star cast. While my opinion will be in the minority, I will be honest as to why The Irishman did not intrigue me and why it may be best to skip it on Netflix, which is a platform I can’t see many starting and choosing to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RS3aHkkfuEI&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) is in a nursing home and is recollecting a wide glimpse of his life, including his time working for Russel Buffalino (Joe Pesci) as a hitman and his involvement with Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best praise I can give to &lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt; is its overall production quality. Deaging effects are heavily relied on in order to tell this story with these characters in different time periods and they are applied seamlessly. Historically, if filmmakers were telling a story that stood across time they would have to hire different actors. The fact that we have seen a surge in films using these effects show that there’s many stories that were once difficult to tell without deaging and it’s interesting because these are all types of movies that couldn’t be told (or at least in this manner) without the innovative technology. Additionally, the production design is superb, as the overall visual look of the film captures the heart of the time periods visited. From the sets, clothing, and props; &lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt; is well-crafted on a technical level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite it’s technical accomplishments, the most important pieces of any movie will always be its story and its characters, which is where &lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt; fails entirely. I would not be complaining about the long running time of &lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt; if the film could warrant that length by drawing me into the story and its characters. I sat on my couch at home for more than four hours in one sitting this past summer to watch Stranger Things Season 3 and did not mind a single moment because that story and its characters intrigued me and the plot consistently and entertainingly moves forward.  For a long period of time, I was left to wonder where &lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt; was going, as the pacing is awfully slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittingly, the acting is terrific from everyone in the cast! However, strong performances without a compelling character can’t save the film. This is a film that has lots of dead time where you are watching characters do an assortment of actions that don’t always seem to connect or advance the plot. I could not relate to Sheeran or any of the characters in the story; never have I been tasked with being a hitman or been in any gang related activity so I could not care about that aspect. A mystery surrounds what actually happened to Jimmy Hoffa but if you are like me and not familiar with Jimmy Hoffa this film does nothing to get you to care. In &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bates Motel&lt;/em&gt; I couldn’t directly relate to selling drugs or being a killer– however, those television shows allowed me to like and care for the protagonists by showing things that they did that I could get behind or relate to. Walter White genuinely care for his family and Norman Bates suffers from a terrible mental disorder that I could feel sympathy for. &lt;em&gt;The Irishman&lt;/em&gt;? I don’t understand what there is to love about any single one of these characters.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/11/2019-11-19-frozen-ii-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Disney has produced a sequel to one of its most popular franchises filled with iconic imagery, hauntingly beautiful music, and light-hearted humor despite having one of the most garbage stories I’ve ever seen. If your only metric is whether or not you’re entertained while watching it, &lt;em&gt;Frozen 2: Frozen Harder&lt;/em&gt; will meet those expectations. However, by any other measure, the film completely fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zi4LMpSDccc&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Frozen 2: A Cold Day to Let it Go&lt;/em&gt;, Elsa and Anna have found a sense of normalcy in their lives after the events of the first movie. However, Elsa has begun to hear a siren’s call that tugs at her heart and reminds her of stories her parents shared about a far off place filled with native people who communed with the spirits of wind, fire, water, and earth. When this call pulls her from her bed in the middle of the night, Elsa finds the spirits from that far off enchanted wood have begun to terrorize the city of Arendelle, driving all of her people from their homes. To restore the status quo, Elsa must take her companions and those closest to her into the enchanted forest where they must uncover the truth of their heritage in order to restore order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I respond strongly to emotional symbols, which is why the moving visual language as well as haunting musical cues of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rog8ou-ZepE&quot;&gt;Frozen 2: Ice Ice Baby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; resonated with me. The trailer is very forward with this aspect of the film as the early teasers showed princess Elsa charging out into the sea again and again.  The film includes a siren’s call weaved into its soundtrack that is chillingly beautiful which resonates with the superficial symbolism. These were easily the best parts of the film for me, and, unfortunately, they set me up for severe disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the main characters from the original (Elsa, Olaf, Anna, Christoff, and Sven) enter into the enchanted wood that serves as the main setting for &lt;em&gt;Frozen 2: Rise of the Evergreens&lt;/em&gt;,  one of the characters promises that the nature of these characters will change. Unfortunately, the story completely fails to deliver on this promise, ending with a return to a status quo that demands no real change from any of the characters. At best the story is a shallow metaphor with high stakes that includes a problematic depiction of indigenous people which resolves its issues with extreme political bias but without any personal sacrifice which leaves the ending feeling hollow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At worst, &lt;em&gt;Frozen 2: The Shivering&lt;/em&gt; forces an awkward narrative about reparations for colonial imperialism onto a franchise where it has no thematic roots. How did we go from a story that succeeded by challenging princess tropes and rejecting flimsy romance for ideas of greater substance about personal identity and responsibility to having these characters fix their parent’s crimes against magical native peoples? Even if the problems in &lt;em&gt;Frozen 2: Beyond the Snow&lt;/em&gt; were able to be resolved meaningfully and dealt with real sacrifice or personal change this would still feel incredibly out of place against the source material. The extensions of the world’s mythology required to force these themes together are broken on a practical level of narrative construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s an entertaining experience to be had here, but I think the original film was meaningful enough that the sequel deserves to be held to the same standard. If all you want is a movie for your kids to watch for 2 hours you’ll find a million things that will serve. If what you need is specifically to see the characters from &lt;em&gt;Frozen&lt;/em&gt; all over again and it doesn’t matter what they’re doing, you’ll get that, too. But if you want any kind of meaningful experience or have any deeper standard than that, you’ll be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/archive/2019/11/2019-11-14-frozen-ii-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;REVIEW&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frozen II&lt;/em&gt; is a sequel to Disney’s 2013 &lt;em&gt;Frozen&lt;/em&gt;. It is directed by Chris Buck and Jenniffer Lee and is a decent family film that is not going to be a hit classic like the first, but I do think is a sequel that families and kids will generally like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best aspect about &lt;em&gt;Frozen II&lt;/em&gt; is that we already care for these characters and so we can immediately dive into new mythology involving Anna and Elsa’s parents as the story has very little setting up to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elsa is concerned when she hears a sound that no one else can hear. Kristoff is figuring out a way to propose to Anna. Anna is concerned for Elsa who appears to be worried throughout the beginning of this movie. Olaf makes funny jokes consistently and has a scene where I almost thought he was going to say, “Mr. Stark I don’t feel so good” The group decide to venture out of Arendelle to a mysterious forest that the sister’s parents had only spoken of. What our characters find in this forest sheds light on the sound Elsa is hearing, the untold backstory of the sister’s parents, as well who Elsa is and why she possesses powers. Oh and there’s music amongst this entire journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The music is okay. There’s a mix of upbeat tunes amongst slower ballads. However, I liked the songs from the first film a lot more; after watching this one, I can really only think of playing back the main track, “Into the Unknown”. The first film obviously had Let It Go, Do You Want to Build a Snowman, Love is an Open Door, and In Summer which I’m going to give up my Man Card and admit that I liked those songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protagonists Elsa and Anna share a bond that is sincere, admirable, and I wanted to see them get answers to some of the questions they wonder regarding their parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the weakest aspect of &lt;em&gt;Frozen II&lt;/em&gt; is the answers that are eventually given surrounding the mystery. Five different people contributed to Frozen II’s story and I’m sure that this is why several aspects are reaching, convoluted, don’t make a lot of sense, or aren’t told in a compelling way. While I liked seeing these characters and wanted them to accomplish their goal, I found the storytelling decisions to be uninteresting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, I do think children, especially those who liked the first, are going to have an entertaining experience seeing these iconic characters back on the big screen and Frozen II is an acceptable family friendly film.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/11/2019-11-08-doctor-sleep-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor Sleep&lt;/em&gt; is a dark well that has more to give the deeper you drill. There are three core layers that it exists at: as a unique suspense thriller, as a sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Shining&lt;/em&gt;, and as a response to Kubrick’s &lt;em&gt;The Shining&lt;/em&gt; by Stephen King. Each of these layers works well but working together they multiply their effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BOzFZxB-8cw&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its own, &lt;em&gt;Doctor Sleep&lt;/em&gt; is an excellent supernatural thriller with clear writing, impeccable technical filmmaking, compelling acting, and beautiful music. It picks up shortly after Kubrick’s adaptation of &lt;em&gt;The Shining&lt;/em&gt; with a young Danny dealing with the trauma at the Overlook hotel. His pain becomes a life long struggle to overcome that is amplified by his shining, a condition that he is only able to cope with by hiding it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an adult, Danny reaches rock bottom as he becomes an alcoholic in his father’s footsteps. Isolated and struggling with relationships, he finds himself homeless and wandering until he finds a support network and a home. He can finally heal as he becomes friends with a young girl named Abra who shines brightly during a time of crises in her life. The film follows along as they both become entangled with a cult called the True Knot who feed on the shining in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pacing is on point, the stories well interweaved, and the statements about healing and recovery resonate with me. We live in a world that is so full of pain that I always gravitate toward stories that share the strength to recover. The music is reserved but compelling with reserved nods to the outstanding work by Wendy Carlos‎ and ‎Rachel Elkind on Kubrick’s film. Additionally, all of the actors achieve a level of excellence as to have their performances feel transparent. Every aspect of the construction is spot-on for a film in a desolate genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considered as a sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Shining&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Doctor Sleep&lt;/em&gt; is a powerful thematic extension of the original that expands King’s world. The inclusion of The Knot, as well as the extension of the Overlook hotel beyond its borders, grow the world by giving us more of the world without over-explaining any of the aspects we have already come to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than that, it expands on the ideas with mirroring rather than exposition. Danny’s alcoholism and struggle with it mirror his father’s. Abra’s shining as a child and the reaction of the world to her shine mirrors the very struggles that Danny experienced as a child. All of these elements serve to grow the world without pulling it apart, which is an extraordinary accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as a faithful adaptation of King’s response to Stanley Kubrick’s subversive use of his original material… &lt;em&gt;Doctor Sleep&lt;/em&gt; is breathtaking. &lt;em&gt;Doctor Sleep&lt;/em&gt; uses its mirroring and its extensions of the world to challenge Kubrick’s earlier work. Where Kubrick is cold and leans into the weakness of Danny’s father as an alcoholic driven by resentment for his family, Stephen King explores Danny’s alcoholism as a response to trauma. Where Kubrick punishes Danny for being different, &lt;em&gt;Doctor Sleep&lt;/em&gt; demands that Abra shines as brightly as possible despite the dangers in the world. Where the Overlook hotel only amplified the evil already within, the cult of the True Knot feeds on what is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any single element here is good enough to stand on its own, but to get a sequel that stands out on so many levels is unprecedented. You can feel in its nature why it took so long to craft something that so perfectly responds to the original while at the same time challenging it.  &lt;em&gt;Doctor Sleep&lt;/em&gt; is a modern cultural touchstone that will be remembered for decades to come just as its predecessor was.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/11/2019-11-07-playing-with-fire-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playing with Fire&lt;/em&gt; should have been called &lt;em&gt;Playing with Stupidity&lt;/em&gt; because this movie is literally stupid physical harm and poop jokes (&lt;em&gt;there is literally a poop joke&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Cena plays Jake Carson, the leader of a group of smokejumpers, who all one day become involved with a group of disrespectful children after rescuing them from a fire. They are tasked with babysitting the relentless troublesome children as the parents are out of town, unable to get their kids. To make matters worse, Carson is going to soon be evaluated for a position he has been coveting. Hopefully he and his team can get the kids to behave or get the parents to pick these brats up before the evaluation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playing with Fire&lt;/em&gt; can be compared to a Saturday morning Looney Toons cartoon show; it’s silly, makes no sense, but it is well aware that it isn’t trying to do anything phenomenal. It could be said that Playing with Fire is an acceptable family friendly film and that is true if you’re not looking for anything clever outside of property getting destroyed and adults getting flustered by children. This is a movie you can watch, turn your brain off, not have to think about anything, and watch over-the-top madness unfold. However, Playing with Fire is one of the most uncreative films, relying on the most obvious jokes that are repeatedly used in a mostly single location. John Cena is constantly reminding the kids that he to be called, “Superintendent Jake Carson” and from ruining a car, to getting mad at a constant screaming child, very little of this movie is memorable and far from outstanding. At best it’s a safe film for young children to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story mostly takes place at Carson’s fire depot, which was such a bland environment. At the end of the film we learn that John Cena’s character actually has a home, where the kids say aloud (and I thought), “You do?!” It seems very challenging to keep the film in one primarily location as there’s only so much one can do in a single space. Outside of putting out fire at the beginning of the film, a store, and Cena’s house, I felt trapped inside of this Fire Depot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heartstrings are far from being pulled on but the film has the audacity to try to take itself seriously in the third act and it unsuccessfully has some boring mooshy past conflicts arise to try to make you sympathize with its characters. Luckily, the film is only an hour and thirty six minutes and so this all flies by too quickly. My criticism is, “If you have already committed to being this absurd for more than half the film, why try to get an ‘aww’ reaction from the audience?” Instead it should’ve embraced its silly tone and gone entirely off the deep end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are content with bottom of the barrel extremely surface level humor then this may amuse you. In fact, my parents loved this movie and thought that the character’s silliness was admirable; while my critic friend said this was possibly the worst movie she had seen this year. Ultimately, the movie will evoke different reactions based on what humor people find amusing. While I didn’t hate this film, I felt like this was beyond mediocre with its effort to do anything remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/archive/2019/11/2019-11-07-doctor-sleep-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Doctor Sleep is the sequel to Stephen King’s The Shining and it’s a creative horror film that takes place years after. Ewan McGregor plays adult Dan Torrance, who was a young boy in The Shining, and he meets a young girl named Abra who has the same strange powers as he does. The villains, known as The True Knot, unfortunately kill people who have these powers and so Dan and Abra have to figure out a way to stop this sinister cult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctor Sleep is a slow burn; there is a lot of setup, building the villains who are thoroughly fleshed out and you understand their motives. Doctor Sleep is a beefy 2 hour and 31 minute film. As a duo, Abra and Dan, are not very riveting, which is why this movie feels as slow as it does. However, fans of The Shining and patient horror audiences will appreciate this eerie tale. I prescribe Doctor Sleep a B-&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/archive/2019/10/2019-10-27-the-two-popes-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Two Popes&lt;/em&gt; is a cathartic exploration of how our religious institutions can be better. Its writing talks about how healing is needed even after forgiveness is received. Being forgiven isn’t enough, the wound must be treated. &lt;em&gt;The Two Popes&lt;/em&gt; powerfully captures the catharsis of tremendous healing and the heavy burden required to treat those cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bOJbHP1TtsU&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director Fernando Meirelles and writer Anthony McCarten have delivered a personal film about the relationship between Pope Benedict XVI and the future Pope Francis. It zooms in on these two men as they discuss philosophy, morality, and football in the time leading up to the election of Pope Francis and the historic resignation of Pope Benedict. By pulling the audience in tightly between these two titans of ideology, it makes us a part of their conversation. The directing and writing deliver a level of intimacy that is moving and I felt the weight of their responsibilities and their guilt. It’s hard to put a value on something that can convey that kind of emotion through such an elegant context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Religious fiction and dramatizations often fail at their core tenet: to ask questions about faith. Almost without fail, modern religious films server more as propaganda or cheerleading than as any sort of exploration of faith.  This is the major reason why I struggle so much with the genre. However, &lt;em&gt;The Two Popes&lt;/em&gt; accepts that faith comes in many forms and that it cannot provide the right answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a careful balance to be had, though, because there are some calls to action here. Everyone fails, even the Pope. When the Pope fails the whole world struggles under the weight of that failure because the church has failed.  Over the past decades, the world has watched carefully as the church let down its flock in ways that don’t really warrant repeating here. We hurt from those wounds and their impact has been felt the world over. As a person who cares deeply about morality, Pope Francis has championed reform in the church that makes the world a better place. He’s spread hope and love in ways that move me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t be fair to this film, because it captured the part of me that craves a better world. I ache for the healing that is delivered here, and &lt;em&gt;The Two Popes&lt;/em&gt; made me feel all of the emotions involved in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s dry. I won’t lie, this is just two guys talking about religion for an hour and a half. But it worked better for me than the most dramatic movie that attempted to deliberately make use of my emotions. It worked for me because it was so honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of reasons why &lt;em&gt;The Two Popes&lt;/em&gt; may not work for you. Maybe the simplicity will fail to capture your imagination. Maybe you’re the type of person who cringes at the trappings of Christianity (though I would argue that the subject of the film is a deep morality that transcends religion). Maybe the ways it challenges faith don’t make you feel as comfortable as other religious works. I’m not sure I can speak to you, and I hope you can forgive me for not being able to objectively discuss this film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt something meaningful, I laughed, and I cried. To me, that is the height of aspiration for all film. I can only hope that &lt;em&gt;The Two Popes&lt;/em&gt; is for you what it is for me… beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/10/2019-10-27-rattlesnake-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;What would you do if you had to kill a stranger in order to save someone that you love? Could you? This is a situation you normally wouldn’t find yourself in and probably never will. However, it is an interesting, “what if” question to ponder. &lt;em&gt;Rattlesnake&lt;/em&gt; director Zak Hilditch takes this demising dilema and weaves together an 85 minute fantasy narrative that has some intrigue but lacks surprises and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katrina (Carmen Ejogo) has to change her tire when her car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. Her young daughter Clara (Apollina Pratt) wanders and is bitten by a venomous snake. Unable to quickly get to the hospital, she accepts the help of a mysterious woman who heals her daughter miraculously! However, Katrina learns that if she wants her daughter to remain in good health she will have to take the life of another human being and she only has until sunset to complete this dreadful task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LhklHFwmBYw&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like Katrina; she is a good mother who cares for her daughter and the beginning of the film clearly demonstrates this. Clara is telling her mom about a conflict she had with another girl her age who was “making faces at her” and how this girl “deserved to be hurt”. Katrina, surprised by her daughter’s response, explains, “Clara, no one deserves to be hurt.” We see the positive beliefs that this mom holds and how she puts forth effort to instill these beliefs in her daughter, without having knowledge that she will soon have these beliefs put to the test regarding the person she cares about more than anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After learning who Katrina is and understanding that she is not the type of person who would want to hurt anyone, we see the unimaginable happen. The film has some effective tense scenes, where you wonder, “Is she going to kill that person?” Because we understand the type of person that Katrina is, we as an audience feel the conflict that she is feeling. “I have to do this. I have to do this,” she repeats to herself not wanting to take the life of another individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These dilemmas do become stale after we realize there’s not many different directions that this premise can go; she’s either going to kill someone or she’s not. Aside from the interesting premise being setup, there is no compelling or surprising way to end it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production set of the hospital is not very impressive, especially after watching Netflix’s other hospital-placed thriller, &lt;em&gt;Fractured&lt;/em&gt;. While most people won’t be bothered, I think that the set could’ve bit lit more ominously and that a darker color grade of blues and greens could’ve added more tension in some of these scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film really struggles to conclude and because of that it puts it on the fence of, “Should I recommend &lt;em&gt;Rattlesnake&lt;/em&gt; or not?” On the one hand you have an interesting premise and a likable lead; on the other hand, you have a film that gets bland in the third act and fails to conclude in a satisfying way. &lt;em&gt;Rattlesnake&lt;/em&gt; may have been better as a 40 minute short.
Many people will be intrigued by the idea that Rattlesnake presents and then at best be mildly content with its climax. There’s no big surprises or big revelations that floored me. However, &lt;em&gt;Rattlesnake&lt;/em&gt; tries its best to hold its entertaining setup but t the bizarre premise mostly traps itself from ending in any type of a compelling manner. A risk is attempted at the very end but it is convoluted, forced, and gave me the impression that the creators were really reaching for that cliffhanger clincher that this film needed to have a stronger bite.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/10/2019-10-26-the-vice-guide-to-bigfoot.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Debuting at the Austin Film Festival this year, &lt;em&gt;The VICE Guide to Bigfoot&lt;/em&gt; lives at the intersecting passion of VICE documentaries with cryptozoology. Writers Zach Lamplugh &amp;amp; Brian Emond are at their best when their satire pleasantly bites at the tropes of click-bait documentaries with nicely sharpened barbs. I wish the general construction had matched the rest of the film at its best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its genuinely comical moments, not all of the gags about YouTube documentaries hit. A good portion of them fall flat, usually in part due to the failure of the cast to sell me on the reality. This comes from a mixture of elements, like the writers not easing off the satire to give enough heart when needed or the actors not having the skill to deliver a line that’s just too cheesy. I found the moments that worked to make the trudge through the cheese worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, though, given writer/director Zach Lamplugh’s background with Adult Swim, that cheese may even be a good portion of the draw for audiences craving a late-night indulgence. It didn’t work for me, though. Even as a fan of the stranger offerings from Adult Swim, such as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzgaX6S_XkY&quot;&gt;Neon Joe: Werewolf Hunter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVhme1eb8SI&quot;&gt;The Eric Andre Show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, I found &lt;em&gt;The VICE Guide to Bigfoot&lt;/em&gt; to not quite work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the main course of the film is comedy, every once in a while it touches that part of you that wants to believe. When the camera gazes out into the woods, my heart follows it and hopes to see something.  The weird thing is that a real documentary couldn’t have captured that feeling. Only a mockumentary could get me quite so invested into wanting to believe. Or maybe I’ve just watched too many episodes of &lt;em&gt;The X-Files&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given everything it has going for it, I do wish the movie had been better put together. It would benefit from some tighter editing, cleaner timing, and stronger acting for the leads. It’s the lead that is burdened with tying the whole thing together and he just doesn’t quite make the film work as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;em&gt;The VICE Guide to Bigfoot&lt;/em&gt; is a clever little quirky comedy that’s going to have a home in a few people’s hearts. Weird, playful, and with just a touch of sincerity, it’s worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/10/2019-10-26-the-true-adventures-of-wolfboy-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t help but think about 2017’s charming flick, &lt;em&gt;Wonder&lt;/em&gt;, when starting &lt;em&gt;The True Adventures of Wolfboy&lt;/em&gt;. Both protagonists are young boys who feel ugly, lonely, and unaccepted because of how they look different from other people. However, the story quickly becomes its own unique tale and it was engaging, relatable, and heartfelt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul (Jaeden Martell) is a thirteen year old who has hypertrichosis, a condition which causes him to have an excess amount of hair all over his body, including his face. Paul is bullied at school because of this, with the kids going as far as to say that Paul’s dad must have had sex with an animal. The identity of Paul’s mother has been a complete mystery until one day Paul receives an invitation to come meet her. After getting into an argument with his father, Paul runs away from home, taking us on an intriguing adventure to locate his mom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul is a likeable character and the setup of the film is told in a compelling manner. There’s enough terrible things that happen to Paul that you wish he could catch a break. It’s also a film all audiences should be able to relate to on some level, as every person has at some point experienced the struggle of being bullied or at least felt unaccepted by those around them. Additionally, our protagonist feels real; he cops an attitude with his father, is unfiltered like a regular teenager, and his motivation for doing what he does feels sincere. The dialogue written for this character was realistic, as I could hear a teenager spouting the words that he uses with his father and those that he meets. Jaeden Martell carries the film with a performance that conveys much emotion despite having a face full of hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pacing doesn’t necessarily slow down in the middle portion of the film, but it meanders in a direction that I didn’t expect. Paul befriends a transgender girl and then another girl who initites a series of petty thefts. These scenes slowly build and shape character, but for awhile I had the sense of, “Where is this going? I want to see Paul get to his mom’s or build upon the mythology presented to us in the interesting setup of the film.” Ultimately, this section of scenes is fine but they are the weakest part of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the film delivers on an effective climax and conclusion. No spoilers here but what Paul discovers once he arrives at his final destination  is compelling. I wish I could use a more descriptive adjective to describe how it’s “compelling” but I want that part of the film to surprise you the way that it did me, including the expectations with the emotions you are likely to experience. The film concludes, bringing everything that has happened in each scene full circle and I was satisfied with how all the characters grew. Martin Krejcí has created a competent movie about accepting who you are that I think will be adored by most audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/10/2019-10-24-countdown-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;If jump scares are your thing, &lt;em&gt;Countdown&lt;/em&gt; servers some of the best ones ever. Writer/director Justin Dec has produced the gourmet version of junk food by executing a cheesy popcorn horror with outstanding technical excellence. I just hope that one day he uses those skills to make a film that’s more my speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/S6O4iy3Twwo&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trailer tells you everything you need to know about &lt;em&gt;Countdown&lt;/em&gt;. One of those time-wasting apps that tells you how long you have left to live tells the truth and ensures that you still meet your fate even if you use its information to stay alive. There is something just perfect about that premise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you could take the material in a more thought-provoking direction, Justin Dec leans into the corniest aspects of the idea. He makes it work by executing it with all of the seriousness of a veteran director working on a meticulous masterpiece. Every scene demonstrates outstanding continuity and awareness of the surroundings of the characters. It’s tremendously difficult to produce such seamless editing and Justin’s work elevates the entire movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These things are small, and most viewers won’t notice how every little plot element is foreshadowed in both the narrative as well as the visual frame, but it’s cool if you know what you’re looking at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the schlockiness of the story, it does have some substance. Sure, the play off of urban legend style psychology is kinda cool, but it gets really fun when the story gets twisted with a little bit of sexual-assault revenge flavor à la &lt;em&gt;Jennifer’s Body&lt;/em&gt;. I honestly wanted the film to skew harder in that direction because it is such fun when it gets there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I am not a fan of jump scares, &lt;em&gt;Countdown&lt;/em&gt; gets the good ones right. They’re creepy, well telegraphed, and it makes you want to cover your eyes right before they happen. I can appreciate well-done craft even when it isn’t targeted at me. However, this was also the weakest part of the movie. Too many of the frights are toothless fake-outs and the film as a whole lacks a deliberateness in its escalation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this movie has a very specific audience in mind despite how well made it is. If you love jump scares, then these are the best you’ll get all year.&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/archive/2019/10/2019-10-22-terminator-dark-fate-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terminator: Endgame Chapter Three Doubletap&lt;/em&gt; is directed by Deadpool director Tim Miller and releases in a season where sequels, reboots, and remakes are Hollywood’s obsession. This film ignores all of the other Terminator movies besides the first two James Cameron films. &lt;em&gt;Rise of the Machines&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Salvation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Genesys&lt;/em&gt;- &lt;em&gt;Terminator: Dark Fate&lt;/em&gt; pretends none of those failed attempts at continuing the series ever happened. The franchise has tried to continue past that legendary &lt;em&gt;Judgement Day&lt;/em&gt; film but has not had any success. &lt;em&gt;Dark Fate&lt;/em&gt; brings James Cameron back in a producing role but it is still yet again another disappointing stab at adding to a series that was once so compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RADIO REVIEW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rzcBeMs9h9U&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terminator 2: Judgement Day&lt;/em&gt; is my favorite Sci-Fi Action movie. I’ve seen that film growing up at least a dozen times and so I of all people am a fan of the franchise and truly wanted to see a good Terminator movie. I had not planned on seeing &lt;em&gt;Dark Fate&lt;/em&gt; as early as I did. My local Alamo Drafthouse actually recently held a disguised Fan Screening which was advertised to show &lt;em&gt;Terminator 2&lt;/em&gt; and only 20 minutes of &lt;em&gt;Dark Fate&lt;/em&gt;, which I didn’t really care for. I can’t review &lt;em&gt;Dark Fate&lt;/em&gt; after all unless I’ve seen the whole thing so that wasn’t a big reason as to why I went. However, since I love &lt;em&gt;T2&lt;/em&gt; so much and have never seen it on the big screen, I immediately got tickets. My friend Brandon and I show up. Arnold and Linda pop up on the screen and they tell us that instead of 20 minutes, we are about to be the first audience in the world to see the entire &lt;em&gt;Terminator: Dark Fate&lt;/em&gt; film. I thought the way they unveiled this secret disguised screening was brilliant and it did make the experience extremely exciting. However, every Terminator film since Judgement Day has paled in comparison and unfortunately &lt;em&gt;Terminator: Dark Fate&lt;/em&gt; is not very different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many early reactions said that this latest film was, “the best terminator movie since &lt;em&gt;Terminator 2&lt;/em&gt;” and I just want to establish that that’s not very high praise. If the reactions said that the film was as good or better than &lt;em&gt;T2&lt;/em&gt; then maybe there would be something to get excited about. Instead, many of these early reactions are simply saying that this movie is better than &lt;em&gt;Rise of the Machines&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Salvation&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Genesys&lt;/em&gt;; that’s not a very high bar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;27 years after Judgement Day, a new Terminator model known as a Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna) is sent to Mexico City in order to kill a woman named Dani (Natalia Reyes) who gets help from Linda Hamilton and Arnold (who reprise their roles from the previous movies) and a new half human and half cyborg character named Grace (Makenzie Davis).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oxy8udgWRmo&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest problems with &lt;em&gt;Terminator: Dark Fate&lt;/em&gt; is that It has an extremely unexpected plot choice that could’ve been very compelling but it’s done so quick and with voice-over narration by Sarah Connor that it was bafflingly underwhelming and really difficult to take seriously. Unfortunately, I can’t get into details because it would be a spoiler. What I will say is that they have Arnold do something that makes absolutely no sense. Even if it’s a different Terminator model, what they choose to do makes everything that was accomplished at the end of &lt;em&gt;Terminator 2&lt;/em&gt; feel less meaningful. If this is supposed to be a true sequel to &lt;em&gt;Terminator 2&lt;/em&gt;, it was the wrong choice to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about what does work in &lt;em&gt;Terminator: Dark Fate&lt;/em&gt; because there are some things to admire. Makenzie Davis has the best action scenes in the film, as she kicks the film off with a brilliant chase and combat scene against the Rev-9 Terminator. This antagonist is threatening and this opener, involving a car chase, quickly shows that. The visuals effects compliment the action and there is a massive amount of them! Even when getting exploded the Rev-9 will regenerate itself and it appears as if nothing will defeat this villain. Sarah Connar joins the team in the fight against this new machine, confidently bringing her expertise about Terminators to the table. Linda Hamilton does a great job acting but I do think that it is Davis who is half human and half cyborg that steals the show with the action. Arnold is fine in this movie but he does not ever have a memorable moment in regards to the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a long-term fan of the first two films, I seek a Terminator film that has heart and doesn’t feel so forced the way that &lt;em&gt;Dark Fate&lt;/em&gt; feels. Much of the  story is recycled plot points from the previous film and there’s not enough themes told in a compelling or emotional way. In &lt;em&gt;T2&lt;/em&gt; you felt the strong sense of injustice based on the way that Sarah Connor was treated (and it built upon the character that we already cared about from the first film). You genuinely felt grief for John who had to learn to say goodbye to someone he learned to love. The writers try to have us care about Grace and Dani’s relationship but I thought the dynamic was too close to what we already got in &lt;em&gt;T2&lt;/em&gt; and that &lt;em&gt;T2&lt;/em&gt; did it better. It feels as if they are trying to create a sensentialized reaction based on doing what’s already been done and it did not resonate with me.  Most people will appreciate the action and passable story, but fans like myself who love the first two films won’t feel satisfied with this contrived story that lacks heart. With the numerous dry attempts at expanding past &lt;em&gt;Terminator 2&lt;/em&gt;, perhaps it is best to admit that this is where this legendary series truly deserves to conclude at.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/10/2019-10-21-knives-out-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;The closing film at Fantastic Fest, &lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt;, comes from &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&lt;/em&gt; director, Rian Johnson. It’s a WhoDunIt thriller with an outstanding cast, an enthralling mystery, and it is directed and communicated exhilaratingly well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financially successful author Harlan Thrombey, played by Christopher Plummer, has died inside  his ginormous victorian-style mansion on his 85th birthday. Daniel Craig plays detective Benoit Blanc, who is mysteriously tasked with trying to figure out &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; killed Mr. Thrombey and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;. After family and friends are all interviewed, it is not clear as to who took their knife out that dreadful night, but it does seem like several people would of had a motive. &lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt; takes us on a thrilling journey that will have wild twists unfold until the very end!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sL-9Khv7wa4&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt; will have you in wonder for a long time and there comes a point where you think you’ve figured out the mystery. Don’t get comfortable with any of your predictions because the movie floored me multiple times! There’s suspense in wondering who did it and thrills involving characters trying not to get caught doing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciated the film’s engaging clarity, as it is surprisingly very easy to follow all of the characters and subplots that this movie presents. One of my worries about going into a movie like &lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt;, where there is a large cast is the characters not getting any depth. &lt;em&gt;Murder on the Orrient Express&lt;/em&gt; was also a whodunit that had a large cast and I didn’t like it very much. There’s so many characters that we barely scratch the surface with who they are and I had the fear that &lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt; would do the same thing. Fortunately, this film does a perfect job at quickly and interestingly establishing the entire ensemble cast. I like that with each character that gets interviewed by the police there’s a lower third title that gives every character’s name. This helped my terrible memory remember who all the characters were and, additionally, each has something unique and interesting about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt; not only has a fantastic screenplay, but it also has a terrific cast! Toni Collete who I adored in Hereditary is in this. We have an Avenger, Chris Evans- he plays a big role during the last two acts of the film. Scream Queen, Jaime Lee Curtis, is intriguing to see as well. The small nuances like the expressions and vocal tone each actor brings make seeing their performance highly entertaining. Amongst the big group of actors, the standout is Ana de Armas, who is Mr. Thrombey’s caretaker, Marta. She hilariously can’t lie without vomiting and so this allows her to be a great resource for police who are trying to uncover what exactly happened to Mr. Thrombey. She carries a large portion of the plot and her sweet caring disposition balanced with determination makes her a likeable character to root for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production design paired with good cinematography make Knives Out a beautiful film to look at. The Thrombey home is enormous and full of rich details in its architecture. Additionally, the screen is consistently filled with saturated colors that pop in every frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt; will hit theaters November 26th, Thanksgiving weekend! I highly recommend it! &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/FFhWCWvTvwI&quot;&gt;Click here to view a live Q&amp;amp;A with Director Rian Johnson (Spoilers may be referred to!)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/10/2019-10-18-zombieland-double-tap-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zombieland: Double Tap&lt;/em&gt; is superior to the original in every capacity. The humor is funnier. Its action is more intense. Each character is richer and deeper. Even the celebrity cameo raises the bar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZlW9yhUKlkQ&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set after the events of &lt;em&gt;Zombieland&lt;/em&gt;, Columbus, Tallahassee, Wichita, and Little Rock find themselves struggling with surviving mundanity and each other more than the zombie hordes. Pressured by an overbearing insistence upon settling from Columbus and Tallahassee in a situation that does not truly meet their needs, Wichita and Little Rock take off to live life on their terms. When Little Rock meets a boy, she leaves Witchita behind in an ironic twist. Left alone, Wichita returns to Columbus and Tallahassee who have found a new companion, Madison. Once reunited, the team then moves on to find and… make Little Rock come home, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I say it out loud, the patriarchal overtones of domestic bliss and nuclear family that seem to be the ideological destination of the film are creepy. I’ll be completely honest, this truth escaped my notice until I was writing it out here. Well damn.  At least it’s subtle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it’s not important. The point of &lt;em&gt;Zombieland&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the story. Similar to the original, &lt;em&gt;Double Tap&lt;/em&gt; is about a nice blend of zombie action with quirky, satirical genre comedy. It benefits from being made 10 years after the original. While this would hurt most franchises, &lt;em&gt;Zombieland&lt;/em&gt; was a little hampered by having been released while the zombie movie craze was in full swing. The majority of its satire was lost in a genre that was already feeling pretty tired, and this worked against its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;em&gt;Zombieland&lt;/em&gt; struggled with originality (outside of &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; scene), &lt;em&gt;Double Tap&lt;/em&gt; has less competition to stand out against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;em&gt;Zombieland: Double Tap&lt;/em&gt; skews harder toward comedy than its predecessor. This differentiates itself more clearly as a satire of the genre, which is a pleasant direction. I laughed more and the laughs were louder. The comedic tone also helps alleviate the thin (if not outright bad) story. Composed as a series of short skits stitched loosely together by the plot, &lt;em&gt;Double Tap&lt;/em&gt; creates a more effective impression of a late 90s zombie flick as opposed to outright being one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acting is on point. While it is always a joy to watch Woody Harrelson at his best, Rosario Dawson steals the show as Nevada. The music is a little old and a little too blunt, but it gets the job done and all of the tracks are good. It’s hard to go wrong with so much great music, but it also would be nice to feel some more creative choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a paper-thin plot with slightly misogynist leanings, &lt;em&gt;Zombieland: Double Tap&lt;/em&gt; is an outright blast. It’s better paced, funnier, and more action-packed than before and will make for a nice punctuation mark to your October.&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/archive/2019/10/2019-10-15-treasure-trouble.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;As a light-hearted comedy of errors, &lt;em&gt;Treasure Trouble&lt;/em&gt; is a breezy adventure in an underserved genre. Judging &lt;em&gt;Treasure Trouble&lt;/em&gt; fairly is a challenge because the genre is so sparse. A well-written series of cascading misunderstandings and accidents is a treat that we only get every few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Treasure Trouble&lt;/em&gt; follows one night of misadventures through the eyes of Eve, a young woman finding her way in life by treasure hunting along beaches. After escaping an unfulfilling office life, Eve is trying to find who she is and live life on her terms. This proves easier said than done as she finds herself taking on a pirate radio host as a room-mate, finding a hidden gun on the beach, and running over the entire city with her ex and his partner while trying to recover her dog who was taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than anything else, I fell in love with the writing in &lt;em&gt;Treasure Trouble&lt;/em&gt;. Writer/director Dan Erickson uses each character to bring something special to the film as a whole. His use of thematic layering is highlighted in the ways his characters relate to the main plot. Every character has a special something that makes them memorable while more tension into the mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the nice thematic layering, there’s also a well-done sense of progression. Each mistake or misunderstanding drives the narrative forward in a compellingly charming way. While the climax doesn’t deliver on the promise of the premise, it doesn’t have to. Would it be a better film if it could?  Probably, but the result is pretty satisfying when all the plot threads wrap up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The climax relies heavily on the performance of Olivia Luccardi in her role as Eve. Olivia delivers on every level, holding the entire film together. The whole film relies on her ability to pull the audience into the chaos of her life and she pulls it off. While there are minor weaknesses in some of the other cast members, Olivia manages to stand out and lift their performances up as they play off of her. It’s an interesting studying in watching as an actor raises the overall production quality around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a film about the chaos of pursuing the life you want as you try to shed one that didn’t quite fit, &lt;em&gt;Treasure Trouble&lt;/em&gt; is beautiful. This one is going to be a gem and a bright spot in your day.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/10/2019-10-14-fractured-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fractured&lt;/em&gt; is the latest installment from director Brad Anderson and it is a very thrilling experience that I highly recommend you stream on Netflix! Despite the fact that those who reflect on plausibility can easily tear this movie a part, I found &lt;em&gt;Fractured&lt;/em&gt; to be one of the most emotionally tense films of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sCimThZW-Ew&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam Worthington plays husband and father Ray Monroe who one day has an existential crisis. While coming back from being out of town, Ray’s daughter Perri (Lucy Capri) hurts herself at a rest stop. Ray and his wife Joanne (Lily Rabe) rush themselves to the emergency room. After dealing with overly rude hospital staff and going through the drudgerous drawn out process of providing insurance information, everything seems like it’s about to work out. Joanne accompanies Perri for testing while Ray awaits them. Shockingly, Ray’s wife and daughter seemingly vanish. When asked about their whereabouts, the hospital has no idea who he is talking about. The film focuses on the husband trying to figure out what happened to his family and uncover what this hospital might have done with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam Worthington’s performance and character are commendable. Prior to the film’s plot taking off, Brad Anderson meticulously displays the state of Ray’s life. Struggling with a rocky marriage and hearing his wife scold, “You’re not the same person that you used to be,” we are left with the impression that this man can’t catch a break despite genuinely caring for his family. Today’s not going to give him that break either. We feel for Ray because even before the vanishings take place, we understand that that this guy has already endured much stress and throughout the entire film you are wishing things can simply work out for him. This proves to be much harder than it seems and what made the twists and turns featured in the film more visceral is that I actually cared for Ray and wanted to see him win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fractured&lt;/em&gt;’s tension-filled plot held my interest from beginning to end. After the vanishing occur, Ray convincingly does what any good father would do, trying his absolute best to prove that his wife and daughter were in fact at this hospital. While the performance can arguably be a bit over-the-top, I thought it was interesting to watch. Not to mention, it’s difficult to imagine how anyone would behave in this incredulous situation- with what Worthington is tasked with, I think he does an excellent job at having fun with the role. He slowly unravels, trying to keep himself composed, until he begins to believe that the hospital may have shady intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the entire rest of the film, we are left to wonder, “Did the hospital want something from his family? Or is our lead crazy?” The film drops hints along the entire way to make you second-guess your predictions. I have heard people argue that, “&lt;em&gt;Fractured&lt;/em&gt; is a predictable thriller” and I would argue that I don’t think there’s any one hint that solidifies what you think the ending might be. Either that or I’m just stupid. I truly believed that the film did a great job at keeping me in suspense until the very last scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the ending itself is a bit of a mixed bag, but the journey to get to that final scene was so brilliantly crafted that I can still recommend going on this mysterious journey.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/10/2019-10-11-the-addams-family-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Addams Family&lt;/em&gt; is directed by Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon, the duo who brought us Sausage Party. This animated flick is certainly more appropriate for children as it is rated PG for slightly suggestive humor and action. However I’m not sure who the target audience is for this film. The script got a few laughs out of me but it was primarily due to the sarcasm (which I personally love) that has Addams family members using language that I think will go way over little kids heads. Perhaps people will appreciate the fact that the film doesn’t dumb the vocabulary down. The characters and the voice actors who portray them are the strongest aspects of The Addams family. Oscar Isaac and Charlize Therion voice parents Gomez and Morticia while Chloe Grace Moretz and Finn Wolfhard voice their kids Wednesday and Pugsley. Each character is quirky, has their own set of unique characteristics, and had some interesting dialogue that reflected that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the plot is a nightmare- and not in a positive Addams-Family type of way. It’s all over the place, lacking focus and not a single element of it is riveting. &lt;em&gt;The Addams Family&lt;/em&gt; live in an old spooky mansion infested with rats and spiders. In the neighboring town, Allison Janney plays a greedy TV Show Host named Ms. Needler who wants to see the Addams family dark creepy home go away in order to increase the attractiveness of the new bright colored homes that she is trying to sell. Gomez is concerned that Pugsbey is not prepared for a sword fight he has to win in order to be considered a true Addams. Wednesday is dealing with surface level teenage drama at her new school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In regards to 3D animation (not referring to anime) anything that is not Pixar is noticeably &lt;em&gt;not Pixar&lt;/em&gt;. I am to a point where I am not sure if I should be upset about it since it’s the norm that Pixar animated films look better than any other studios (that I’ve seen). However, it’s an acceptable 3D animated film when put against other studios. I did like how the character and set designers intentionally made everything that the Addams’ family wore or owned, including their home, dark and old. In contrast, the neighboring town was full of bright saturated colors. This communicated the differences between the community and the kooky family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a good lesson at the heart of the film about being true to who you are. Pugsbey isn’t into sword fighting; he’s into throwing explosives. Wednesday and her new friend at school Parker realize they should dress how they want (despite if it goes against what others say they should look like). It’s just a lesson we’ve all seen before that’s been told in an extremely more compelling way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the movie does not overstay its welcome. It’s a fast-paced 87 minutes and tells its mediocre story with its quirky characters acceptably. While I thought the characters were interesting, 0% of me was emotionally invested in the challenges they faced. I mildly enjoyed their sarcastic dialogue. That’s it. The plot truly felt like it could have been cut into three separate thirty minute episodes and I think that’s where this should have landed: on a children’s television station as separate episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, &lt;em&gt;The Addams Family&lt;/em&gt; is a mixed bag. I didn’t love it or hate it. It’s up in the air with how kids will respond to it. If you have yet to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eskimotv.net/articles/2019/09/28/abominable-2019/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abominable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that film is truly the better family movie at the moment. If you are eager to see something new or Halloween themed, I don’t think this is a movie you will regret seeing. It happens so quick. At the same time, it’s not a movie I would recommend to run out to see.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/10/2019-10-11-jexi-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jexi&lt;/em&gt; is directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, the directors who bought us &lt;em&gt;Bad Moms&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bad Moms Christmas&lt;/em&gt;. It is an over-the-top unrealistic silly comedy that made me chuckle a few times at the beginning but then features comedy that becomes repetitively dull and does not have enough unique jokes to warrant it being a feature-length film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/txSOaY-je-o&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phil (Adam Devine) is addicted to his phone. He has no friends but relies heavily on his smart device until one day it breaks. Unfortunately, Phil does not purchase the new iPhone 11 Pro. Instead, he gets a phone with Jexi. The interesting thought of, “What if Siri or Alexa was rude and had a mind of her own?” comes to life in this movie– but instead of Siri, you have Jexi, a virtual personal assistant voiced by Rose Byrne. This phone is extremely volatile constantly calling Phil, “a stupid idiot,” (in addition to a bunch of cuss words) and a bit raunchy, as the phone loves when Phil inserts her charger in and out rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a funny premise to play with but one that can’t be stretched very long. The film knows this, as it is a short 84 minutes. However, it struggles to even fill that time. After the first few scenes that the phone is vulgar, it gets old. You become desensitized to the weird fact that the phone is mean and you start to ask yourself, “Is anything new going to happen?” The phone decides to spout inappropriate insults in front of Phil’s boss and a girl he is interested in. Every insult a phone could possibly say is spued. It’s funny at first but then nothing intriguing or unique truly happens. There’s four music video style sequences that are unnecessary. These are not terrible to watch, but they are clearly used as overly long transitions used to fill more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stupidity is embraced and &lt;em&gt;Jexi&lt;/em&gt; mostly doesn’t take itself seriously- which I did appreciate. However, there is a romance plot involving a girl named Cate (Alexandra Shipp) who mostly feels like a plot device used to give the film a conclusion. Phil likes this beautiful woman but it seems like he’ll never have a chance. Despite Jexi being jealous and trying to sabotage the relationship, you’ll never be able to guess how it all ends (there’s 0% sarcasm with that last statement). Michael Peña plays an over-demanding boss which, like the cursing phone, is comical at first but then quickly loses his flare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jexi&lt;/em&gt; may have worked as a funny short film but to throw in a forced romantic plot, four music videos, and to repeatedly use the same jokes that get dry after the first act result in a lukewarm underwhelming experience. It’s not flat out boring but it’s insulting to request 84 minutes of our time to do so little.&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/archive/2019/10/2019-10-10-black-and-blue-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;For a film about racism, police brutality, and the value of every life, they sure do have a bunch of cops in hand-me-down warzone gear murder a whole lot of black drug dealers. But, positively, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klo4HI7c_TM&quot;&gt;because it’s a swat raid&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s one of the ways we’re supposed to think of the police as being absolutely right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QCfSeVCr7ng&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black and Blue&lt;/em&gt; is the high-end premium packaged version of civil rights. The text of the film talks about the problems caused by corrupt or racist police officers, but the subtext is telling us everything was fine just a couple of years ago. The problem with our civil services isn’t caused by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUdHIatS36A&quot;&gt;how they’re structured&lt;/a&gt;, it’s just a few bad apples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bright-eyed rookie cop (but two tour military veteran) is forced to run for her life after catching the murder of drug dealers by rogue police officers on her body cam. Trapped in a fantasy version of a gang-ridden city, she is crushed between an entirely black population that can only see the blue of her uniform and the infiltrated police force. Her only hope of survival is to pit these rival forces against each other while trying to escape the chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the ingredients are there for a truly modern thriller. We’re in the middle of a real-world society gone mad with police corruption wrestling with the revolution of body cams. The setting is perfect for dealing with race and gender inequality while dealing with the very human fears that so many Americans suffer today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, all &lt;em&gt;Black and Blue&lt;/em&gt; delivers is the diet flavored revolution. The main character, Alicia West (portrayed by the fantastic Naomie Harris), champions the ideals of personal accountability. The world today is a result of the choices of individuals, not a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaD84DTGULo&quot;&gt;failure of the system&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a subtle way to dig at the audience that our problems are our own fault. It glorifies the lethal and militarized extermination of thugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the repackaged version of rebellion that supports the status quo. And that’s troubling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, you will probably enjoy &lt;em&gt;Black and Blue&lt;/em&gt; if you watch it. It’s entertaining. The action is a blast. Many of the characters are likable. And, I won’t lie, I want to believe that everything can be fixed with our existing systems through personal integrity. That’s a compelling lie. It’s comforting as it speaks to the ethics I was raised with. And it will probably speak to yours as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film is well structured, the acting is top-notch, and the music is serviceable. If you watch &lt;em&gt;Black and Blue&lt;/em&gt; casually, it will meet all of the criteria of a good movie. No matter what your metrics are, &lt;em&gt;Black and Blue&lt;/em&gt; is a solid movie as it is incredibly effective at conveying its real ideas. You may even agree with its real message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I still can’t help feeling like I just walked out of the Hot Topic of civil rights politics.&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/archive/2019/10/2019-10-06-parasite-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt; is directed by Bong Joon-ho and I had the amazing opportunity to see it at the closing night of Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas. &lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt; has a unique creative story, characters that feel real, and an underlying message about high and low class families that is conveyed thrillingly. This is a South Korean film but please go see this movie when you can. It won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Films Festival and it is such a rewarding experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kim family is poor. A father, mother, and their son and daughter all live in the basement of a dilapidated apartment struggling to survive. Choi Woo-shik portrays high school son Ki-Woo, who’s friend one day tells him that he is moving to study abroad and asks Ki-Woo if he’d like to take over as an English tutor for the rich Park family’s daughter. Ki-Woo is nervous because he is not qualified to tutor but luckily his sister Ki-jung, played by Park So-dam, knows how to use Photoshop and drafts her brother a fake resume. The story revolves around the luxurious family not only inviting Ki-Woo into their home, but eventually the rest of the Kim family. How all the family gets involved and what unfolds after is truly a masterpiece of cinema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I’ve said enough about the plot to pique your interest, but there is so much more that this movie has underneath the general plot synopsis that you might read online. The screenplay written by director Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won is clever and engaging. Most of the comedy is in the first 2 acts and pokes fun at how easy it is for the poor Kim family to get involved with the rich Park family. I don’t want to spoil what exactly they do but they perform some incredulous acts and it was quite amusing to see the creativity behind all of their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, just when you think you’ve figured out the type of film this is going to be, the movie dumps a crazy unexpected bombshell that caused me to audibly gasp right in the middle of it. &lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt; quickly becomes a dark thriller that you can’t help but be in wonder of how it will all end. At this particular point in the movie, you are already invested in all the characters from both of these families. Seeing what they all decide to do extremely thrilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the plot being entertaining and communicated wonderfully well, there is a message about social classes. Director Bong Joon-ho talked about the title, “Parasite” and how in this film it applied to both families; despite the poor family trying to use the rich family’s money- the rich family who can’t do simple things like wash the dishes use money in exchange for extensive labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt; is winning Best Foreign Film at the Oscars. It is likely going to be my favorite movie of 2019. It’s so brilliant and I love it the more that I think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/10/2019-10-06-little-monsters-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Little Monsters&lt;/em&gt; is written and directed by Abe Forsythe. I had the chance to see it at the SXSW film festival back in March and I never thought I’d be writing a review for it, as I did not think this disposable comedy would ever see the light of day outside of the festival. To my dismay, people love it. It’s at an 88% on the tomato-meter at the time of this review being written and you can find this zombie comedy streaming on Hulu October 11th. However, I think the comedy is lackluster and that the characters are awfully hollow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lupita Nyong’o plays an elementary school teacher named Ms. Carol, and one day she takes her class on what should be an exciting field trip to Pleasant Valley Farm! Dave, played by Alexander England, has a nephew in Ms. Carol’s class and so he decides to volunteer to go on the trip, secretly having a crush on the teacher. This trip should be fun but unfortunately zombies show up! The film focuses on Dave and Ms. Carol working with a sly kids personality host, who’s played by Josh Gad, in order to escape the hordes of zombies, while keeping a class of kids under control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zombies amidst kids would create opportunities for true disturbance but unfortunately the screenplay calls for Nyong’o’s character to be unrealistically fearless. This is apparent when she chooses to bust out a guitar and sing a song despite all the dangers that surround them. I understand she is a teacher and wants to stay calm so the children don’t become wildly worried. Unfortunately, this indifferent attitude she has towards supernatural zombies that show up ruined any form of realistic intrigue that the zombie premise brings. She proceeds to lie in order to prevent the children from thinking there’s any real danger, explaining that they’re playing a game of tag. “It’s a part of the game. The zombies aren’t real,” she tells them. There’s nothing scary or eerie about this story or these zombies, which is fine- the creators clearly are not going for that. The problem is there’s not much else it does successfully either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there’s no realism to admire, the film relies heavily on comedy, which apparently I’m the only one who didn’t find funny. Josh Gad has never annoyed me to the degree that he does in this film. His character is unreasonably harsh, trapping the kids and Ms. Carrol outside of the only enclosed area they can flee from the zombies. The humor derives mostly from the adults trying to keep the kids calm, the adults having arguments about what they should be focused on or be doing, and bottom-of-the-barrel physical harm humor. There’s a forgettable romance that develops between Nyong’o and Englands’ characters shoved in the middle of all of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Little Monsters&lt;/em&gt; is similar to &lt;em&gt;Anna and the Apocalypse&lt;/em&gt;, which both feature zombies, comedy, and music (Anna featuring more choreographed musical style songs). The one undeniably commendable aspect of &lt;em&gt;Little Monsters&lt;/em&gt; is the full effort you can see Lupita Nyong’o putting forth in her performance. Unfortunately, the comedy misses and the film misses an opportunity to take a more serious approach.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/10/2019-10-06-jojo-rabbit-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jojo Rabbit&lt;/em&gt; is directed by Taika Waititi and I got the chance to see it early at Fantastic Fest 2019 in Austin, Texas. Unfortunately, &lt;em&gt;Jojo Rabbit&lt;/em&gt; features satire throughout the script that failed to make me laugh consistently. There’s several one liners that are so absurd that the only intention is clearly for comedy but I found several of these lines to be unamusing and some may find them to be offensive. Ultimately, the script’s mass amounts of dialogue was either unengaging or simply went way over my head (probably the latter). If you are passionate or at least well-versed with the World War II time period, you may enjoy the film more than I did. Outside of the comedy that mostly didn’t work for my humor taste, there is a message and some great character moments that were admirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 year old Jojo Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) gets coined the nickname &lt;em&gt;Jojo Rabbit&lt;/em&gt; when he is too scared to break a rabbit’s neck at his “Hail Hitler” youth camp. Rabbit’s only comfort is his imaginary friend who happens to be an over-the-top silly version of Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi). Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell) tells the boys they will be learning “manly things,” like grenade launching and knife throwing during the camp. Jojo is perplexed when he one day learns that his mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a young Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film is shot and edited competently well. Specifically, the color palette of warm dark reds, yellows, browns, and greens all pop, vibrarantly saturated. Despite the film looking pretty, I wonder if the film would have benefited from being shot on less-attractive grainy film since that style would more accurately reflect the time period. Nonetheless, the picture is always pleasant to look at, thanks to cinematographer Mihai Mălaimare Jr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A shocking situation like finding someone being hidden in your home is not as shocking as it would be if the film was taken more seriously. Because the film is silly and feels like anything can happen, I didn’t find this boy’s discovery to be intriguing. If Hitler can appear so real to our young protagonist then why should anything in the film surprise me? “It’s not supposed to surprise you- it was in the trailer,” someone may refute. Good point, but it’s a missed opportunity because had that been a focal point that was executed in a serious trajectory, I may have become more invested in that plot point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jojo Rabbit&lt;/em&gt; lacks focus, as the young girl being hidden and the Hitler camp feel unrelated. Rebel Wilson is in this movie so her name can be on the poster. The best moments of the film are between Davis and McKenzie’s characters as the young actors have the most heartfelt dialogue, which eventually causes Jojo to take a look at many of his beliefs. The conclusion to the story is satisfying because the protagonist experiences a positive-fitting character arc, which had me smiling at the very end. However, the overall plot and the humor throughout was so dull that I can’t recommend you run out to see &lt;em&gt;Jojo Rabbit&lt;/em&gt;, unless you are already oozing with passion to see World War II satire amidst a lighthearted story.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/10/2019-10-03-joker-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;The whole of &lt;em&gt;Joker&lt;/em&gt; is summed in a single powerful image: a plain-faced, average-looking man bursting out with involuntary laughter, a hand clasped over his mouth, and sincere pain clearly visible behind his eyes. This poignant image appears early in the film to set the tone. &lt;em&gt;Joker&lt;/em&gt; isn’t for everyone. It’s tragic, slow, and sad. This is a movie that is not meant to be enjoyed in a traditional sense, and I think that will be reflected when audiences see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zAGVQLHvwOY&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joker&lt;/em&gt; is a mid 80s period piece that explores the origins of Batman’s most iconic villain, The Joker (known as Arthur Fleck in the film and portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix). Historically, The Joker has not benefitted from having a fleshed-out origin story. Like a force of nature, having more in common with the horror of staring into the abyss than traditional comic book villainy, definition robs him of what makes him powerful. The Joker is terrifying because he is the void, and the void cannot have a shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, writer/director Todd Phillips found something special in this character. The Joker is neither the hero nor the villain. He is a victim of mental illness. In reality, &lt;em&gt;Joker&lt;/em&gt; is less an origin story for The Joker than it is a meticulous exploration of madness born from pain and uncertainty. What sets it apart from similar films is how successfully it disentangles that madness from the underlying mental illness that is at its heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the exploration of the mingling of mental illness with poverty, abuse, and neglect as a powderkeg of emotion and violence works, some of the metaphors are a little too on-the-nose. Todd Philips uses world-building to parallel the explosion of Arthur Fleck’s life. The story dives headfirst into the ways that society fetishizes mental illness even as it ostracizes the mentally ill. The crowds make a symbol out of a man who is dying on the inside and who has lost his way.  It may be a little over blunt in how it tells the audience that The Joker is not to be emulated, while it could never possibly be blunt enough to hit the people who need to understand this the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todd Phillips does his best world-building in the areas that reflect the troubles of Arthur Fleck in those of everyone else. He captures some real-life feelings of disenfranchisement in a world that cares more about the rich than it does about justice. Helplessness is everywhere. Similar to how everyday people both obsess over madness even as they revile those who struggle with disability, so too are the poor both constantly the focus of the wealthy even as they are dismissed in any meaningful capacity. It’s stunning how well the story and world-building tie these ideas together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was deeply worried when I went into the film that The Joker would be portrayed as a misunderstood vessel for the world’s poison as a setup to justify his inevitable lashing out at everything and everyone around him… but he’s not. Joaquin Phoenix portrays a man who is loved but doesn’t know how to process that love. A man helpless in a world where he cannot tell what is real and what is fake. His own body betrays him, his laughter the condition of a neurological illness that is no more bound to how he feels than a cramp to anyone else. And it is constant and disruptive in his daily interactions. He’s frustrated and isolated by the failures of the people around him and he is falling apart as every support in his life crumbles away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Todd Phillips has given The Joker an origin story, he has maintained him as a force of nature. Arthur Fleck is what happens when we fail, and we are failing all the time. He is the inevitable result of when we fail each other. He is a call for compassion and love in all of the places where we fail to share it. That is the greatest strength of what the cast and crew have created here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I speak so glowingly of this film because &lt;em&gt;Joker&lt;/em&gt; resonated with me. I do need to talk about its flaws, though, because they are present. &lt;em&gt;Joker&lt;/em&gt; is not perfect. By far the biggest issue is the ending. Thematically, it fails to deliver on the promises the film makes and turns into a paint-by-number Batman movie. I don’t know how Todd Phillips could have ended it, though. The problem with the depth of material that is addressed through most of the story is that it doesn’t have a satisfying ending. While the ending is disappointing, it doesn’t feel like it fails to satisfy in a deliberate way. It could possibly have ended more abruptly and been a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I think real fans of The Joker and the best stories about his character will get it, there are a lot of people who want an entertaining comic book movie. Or a horror movie they can feel good about afterward. Or they want something like &lt;em&gt;Venom&lt;/em&gt; that they can identify with. You know who you are and I appreciate you and your tastes, so I do not mean this in a dismissive way, but if you need any of those things… you aren’t going to get them here. It’s an uncomfortable, sad, and introspective ride with only a few exclamation points of violence. This is the type of movie that tries to make you feel bad for the things you want out of your movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, though outstandingly constructed, beautiful acted, insightful, and powerful, I believe &lt;em&gt;Joker&lt;/em&gt; is going to be a divisive film. I love it, and it is beautifully crafted. But I like movies that make me feel like crap from time to time, so it was right up my alley.&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/archive/2019/10/2019-10-01-dolemite-is-my-name-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Dolemite Is My Name is an insightful and hilarious Netflix movie directed by Craig Brewer.  I got the chance to see it early at Fantastic Fest in Austin Texas. It was actually one of the surprise secret screenings of the festival. The film will be in select theaters on October 4th and available for streaming on Netflix October 25th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eddie Murphy portrays the real-life rap legend Rudy Ray Moore, who is better known by his stage name, Dolemite. Focusing on his days before fame, the movie hones in on Dolemite’s stand up comedy and the movies he wanted to create which often reference scandulous sex, drugs, and violence. At the time, radio stations and movie studios were not willing to air or produce this type of content. The film focuses on the uphill battle of adversity that Rudy faces to eventually leave behind a legacy that influenced many lives after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real Rudy Ray Moore died in 2008. I actually was not familiar with who he was but Dolemite is my Name paints a really great picture and displays this character in an entertaining and interesting way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every review that you see will highlight Eddie Murphy’s performance. The high-energetic flare he brings to Dolemite livens every scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the biggest strength of Dolemite Is My Name is seeing the strong resilient character never give up. Despite me not actually caring about Moore’s vulgar humor or movies, I was enamored and loved seeing him not quit. As a society we love to see people accomplish great things; someone loses 100 pounds, a scholar graduates, a new career is started– it’s tremendously admirable because we know these types of accomplishments are really difficult and that’s there’s plenty of people who give up. We understand the hard work that must be put into accomplishing a big goal. If there’s one thing true of Rudy Ray Moore, it’s that this man was a very hard worker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had empathy for Dolemite consistently; when his plans don’t pan out the way he wants, you feel the frustration that he feels. Many people, especially creative people like myself, are truly going to be able to relate to Dolemite. EskimoTV started in 2017 and it’s been a challenge to be recognized as a legitimate outlet. I was once told that I will never be on Disney or Warner Bros. press list.. I, like Rudy Ray Moore, found value in persisting and it’s a great quality to see people exercising to such a high degree. In that regard, this movie is quite inspiring and hopefully someone who sees this that is about to throw in the towel will decide to get back up and try again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script which is written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski is consistently funny. Character’s conversations are really interesting and the confident words that fly out of Rudy Ray Moore’s mouth is often hilarious. However, there’s a scene where Moore goes on stage as Dolemite for the first time. It’s during stand up comedy and I didn’t think his humor in these types of scenes was all that funny. However,the audience in the movie is erupting with laughter. I get this is done to communicate that this Dolemite character is a hit but it just felt a little contrived. Luckily, scenes like that are often short and once again, the actual conversations characters have with one another are really great.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Whistlers&lt;/em&gt; D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to outline my experience from traveling to Austin, share brief thoughts on the movies I saw, dig into some exciting events and points of interest from the festival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thursday&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting to Fantastic Fest was not so fantastic. On the contrary, it was extremely stressful. I left at 11 AM with the hopes of having time to comfortably walk around before the 5 PM opening film, Jojo Rabbit. Unfortunately, tropical storm Imelda flooded the streets of Houston, which caused me to be stuck in water mazes for 2 hours. I did not think it would be as hard as it ended up being to leave the city. After two hours of aimlessly driving, turning my back on flooded streets, and finding alternative routes, I depressingly pulled into a Shell gas station pictured below for three hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;text-align:center;font-size:small;color:#003366;background:#D6EAF8;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2019/09/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shell Gas Station&quot; title=&quot;Shell Gas Station&quot; style=&quot;max-height:35vh;vertical-align:middle;padding:5px 5px 2px 5px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;The gas station was at a higher incline and I felt safe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was too late to go back home and I did not want to risk my car flooding. At one point before stopping at the Shell, I hesitantly drove my car into some shockingly deep waters. I was prepared to leave my car where it was at, walk to a hotel, and ultimately miss the festival. Before resorting to a hotel, I downloaded Waze Maps and was looking at routes clear of water. To pass time, I walked across the street. Ate Raising Canes so I wouldn’t be hangry (Kid’s Meal strips if anyone was curious). I had the slight worry of my car getting towed but then had the comforting thought: if the tow company causes my car to get flooded then maybe that wouldn’t be so bad since they’d have to cover the damages… “It is highly unlikely they’ll tow my car given the circumstances,” my mind concluded. I texted friends and family. I napped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thank the Lord Baby Jesus!” I shouted (or some verbiage to that effect)! Three hours later (at 5 PM) there was one route free of water that I could see from the Waze map. This allowed me to leave the city! I hesitantly left the Shell gas station and drove painstakingly slow behind cars until I got on the highway! My ETA was 8:10 PM and I was sad I would be missing Jojo but happily determined to make it on time for my scheduled 8:30 PM showing of First Love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Send me on the way” by Rusted Root is my car song whenever I drive out of town. Jamming to that and other stellar songs that just so happened to be on my playlist, I was able to quickly arrive in Austin and park inside the Alamo South Lamar parking lot at 8:08 PM (lowkey proud that I was able to “beat” Google’s suggested time - anyone else know the feeling?!). “Where do I get my press badge?!” I enthusiastically asked the first living creature I could spot my eyes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019/09/3%20Press.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jason&#39;s Press Badge&quot; title=&quot;Jason&#39;s Press Badge&quot; /&gt;&lt;i&gt;It was Fantastic Fest&#39;s 15th anniversary and so we were to upload a photo from when were 15.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting my badge, I gleefully frolicked to the Alamo South Lamar theater, seated in a surprisingly good seat at 8:20 PM. Everything ended up working out from that point on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019/09/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Alamo Drafthouse&quot; title=&quot;Alamo Drafthouse&quot; /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alamo Drafthouse South Lamar&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not in love with &lt;em&gt;First Love&lt;/em&gt; but I liked individual aspects of it. It was very ambitious- cramming action, comedy, and a plethora of characters. The character motivations didn’t always seem believable and the comedy diffused much tension as it is silly and contrived. If they were going for silly and contrived, I tend to prefer that 200% Commit. Go all the way. They balance the humor with action and a story that they seemed to also want people to take seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019/09/4%20Espolon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Theater 5, Espolon&quot; title=&quot;Theater 5, Espolon&quot; /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The coveted Espolon theater (theater #5) has the largest screen at Alamo and housed live talents involved with the making of a film and/or cast members.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish my first flick had been one I had enjoyed more but nonetheless I was still happy to be dry and away from flood waters. I decided to cut Thursday night short, missing the late midnight screening, in exchange for getting extra sleep so I could make it on time for the very attractive 8 AM press screening of &lt;em&gt;Jojo Rabbit&lt;/em&gt; (no sarcasm there considering I am not a morning person.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The friend that I was staying with Friday - Sunday night was different from the friend I was staying with Thursday night so that meant Friday morning I would have to pack everything up in addition to getting dressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;friday&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEEP BEEP BEEP&lt;/strong&gt;- my alarm droned at 5:45 AM. I thought I would be safe leaving at 6:45 AM. Unfortunately, Austin has heavy traffic and it would take an hour to get to the theater! I could not miss my &lt;em&gt;Jojo Rabbit&lt;/em&gt; screening again! I took toll roads, unsure if my Houston EZtag would work on Austin’s TXtag but I had no choice- if I stayed on the free roads I’d be too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annoyingly coughing and feeling exhausted from being up so early, &lt;em&gt;Jojo Rabbit&lt;/em&gt; ended being a hard-to-sit-through experience. I really wanted to like it. Much of the satire was not funny to me. Half of the reasoning as to why you like Jojo is because of the humor. It either wasn’t very clever or just went way over my head (probably the latter). I did like the character moments between the protagonist and a girl he finds inside the basement of his home. Outside of that, I did not find the script and most of the other characters to be intriguing. “What’s wrong with me!?” I thought. “Maybe I’m tired. Or cranky because of the flood situation.” I had not loved anything but had hopes that the films would get better. That hope would turn into a reality with my next film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up taking a break that afternoon, meeting up with my friend that I’d be staying with, Chris, at WingStop. That was very reenergizing. I decided to work on posting reviews on the EskimoTV.net website I had needed to post and saving up my energy for back-to-back showings of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Death of Dick Long&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the Tall Grass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;text-align:center;font-size:small;color:#003366;background:#D6EAF8;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2019/09/DickLongDirector2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Director Daniel Scheinert and I at Fantastic Fest 2019&quot; title=&quot;Director Daniel Scheinert and I at Fantastic Fest 2019&quot; style=&quot;max-height:35vh;vertical-align:middle;padding:5px 5px 2px 5px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Director Daniel Scheinert and I at Fantastic Fest 2019.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Death of Dick Long&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was a fantastic experience! I had the pleasure of sitting next to my friend and Houston Film Critic Society colleague, James Cole Clay, who had seen the film before. We laughed consistently and it was uniquely suspenseful! For my full review of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Death of Dick Long&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, click &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;text-align:center;font-size:small;color:#003366;background:#D6EAF8;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2019/09/TallGrassTalents.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;In the Tall Grass talents&quot; title=&quot;In the Tall Grass talents&quot; style=&quot;max-height:35vh;vertical-align:middle;padding:5px 5px 2px 5px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the Tall Grass Red Carpet Interviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the Tall Grass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was my next film. The beginning was extremely engaging and I thought I was about to catch another gem. Unfortunately, In the Tall Grass goes downhill quickly after it’s attention-getting introduction. To find out why, click &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for my full review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;text-align:center;font-size:small;color:#003366;background:#D6EAF8;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2019/09/Selfie.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Late Night Selfie&quot; title=&quot;Late Night Selfie&quot; style=&quot;max-height:35vh;vertical-align:middle;padding:5px 5px 2px 5px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Late night selfie at my friend Chris&#39;s awesome apartment!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s almost 11 PM. I went to my friend’s apartment. He had gone to sleep and I hadn’t been given the front gate code. Unbeknownst to me there was another gate that was always open. I waited 20 minutes for a car to open the front gate and I quickly made my way to the apartment. Once in, I was very happy that I was able to stay and I fell asleep quite quickly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;saturday&quot;&gt;Saturday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That morning, I would see the &lt;em&gt;The Whistlers&lt;/em&gt; which would be the worst film I would have to watch at Fantastic Fest. It was a chore to keep my eyes open. It was a foreign film and the premise was absurd: people were learning a different language using whistle sounds in order to not be understood by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the showing, I decided to write reviews at Starbucks and skip &lt;em&gt;Swallow&lt;/em&gt;. I really wish I had seen the film after hearing good things about it; but at the same time, I was very happy to have wrote two reviews during that time period. Also, I continued to check to see if any tickets for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Lodge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; would pop up during that time, as it was a movie I really wanted to see given the premise and it’s far-off 2020 release was appealing. I was lucky to find a single leftover ticket and had I gone to see Swallow I may have missed that opportunity!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Lodge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; started at 5:25 PM. I was super stoked I got in to see this! I was in the last boarding group and the volunteer would not let me in even when our phones indicated “ALL” groups were allowed in. I ended up sitting in an uncomfortable folding chair. Luckily, I had brought my jacket and it provided enough cushion for the chair to be comfortable for about 70% of the movie. Nonetheless, I was treated with a very well-directed horror gem! For my full review, click &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;VFW&lt;/em&gt; was after, at 8:25 PM, and this was not my cup of tea. &lt;em&gt;VFW&lt;/em&gt; is about a futuristic society who are addicted to a drug that eventually makes you zombie-like. A girl steals the drug distributor’s stash and this dealer, his friends, and the zombie-like community chase the girl and new friends that she meets. It’s ultra violent. There’s little story beyond this. If you like bloody gory action, you’ll have a good time with &lt;em&gt;VFW&lt;/em&gt;. I got bored after a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decided to call it a night after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sunday&quot;&gt;Sunday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019/09/FracturedPoster.png&quot; alt=&quot;Jason Escamilla before the premiere of Fractured.&quot; title=&quot;Jason Escamilla before the premiere of Fractured.&quot; /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jason Escamilla before the premiere of Fractured.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the last day of the festival for me. I was excited for Fractured at 5 PM. I debated about going to The Platform at 2 PM but a screener link had been provided earlier on. Instead, I chose to park at the nearby coffee shop, write about &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Lodge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and save my energy for the evening. Also, I had not been assigned “Secret Screening 1” and would be refreshing my page to try and get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon arriving at the coffee shop, I sat next to two girls who were really pretty and seemed very nice. I noticed that they had Festival Badges on as well. “Did ya’ll get Secret Screening 1?” I inquired. “I really want to be able to see it if possible!” One of the girls named Logan replied, “Oh yes, I have it and I was waiting for someone to ask me for it!” JESUS LOVES ME, YES I KNOW. What’re the odds of this?! “She transfers me her ticket and I am ecstatic! I finish writing my review for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Lodge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and go in for Fractured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;text-align:center;font-size:small;color:#003366;background:#D6EAF8;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2019/09/MichaelCHall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo with Michael C. Hall&quot; title=&quot;Photo with Michael C. Hall&quot; style=&quot;max-height:35vh;vertical-align:middle;padding:5px 5px 2px 5px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jason Escamilla and Michael C. Hall&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before heading in for &lt;em&gt;Fractured&lt;/em&gt; I had to take a photo with Michael C. Hall, who plays the lead on one of my favorite television shows of all time, &lt;em&gt;Dexter&lt;/em&gt;. “Can I take a photo with you?” I asked Hall intimidatingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019/09/ShadowOfTheMoon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shadow of the Moon talents&quot; title=&quot;Shadow of the Moon talents&quot; /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shadow of the Moon talents&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hmm, if you can walk and take it at the same time,” Michael replied (which was a totally reasonable response as he and the cast for the Netflix film Shadow of the Moon were walking in for the premiere of their film!) “Thank you!” I told him and I went into &lt;em&gt;Fractured&lt;/em&gt;, as &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Moon&lt;/em&gt; would be released on Netflix before &lt;em&gt;Fractured&lt;/em&gt; would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;text-align:center;font-size:small;color:#003366;background:#D6EAF8;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2019/09/FracturedInterviews.png&quot; alt=&quot;Interviews with Fractured talents&quot; title=&quot;Interviews with Fractured talents&quot; style=&quot;max-height:35vh;vertical-align:middle;padding:5px 5px 2px 5px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Interviews with Fractured talents&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fractured&lt;/em&gt; ended up being a thrill ride! I have a feeling that others won’t love it as much as I did. It asks you to believe a lot and the ending is admittingly questionable. However, this film’s plot was enthralling, getting the most audible reactions from me and is led with a passionate performance by Sam Worthington. I had to hold back on talking to the characters! After all, this was not a watch-out-loud screening (insider with HFCS). I have yet to write a review, but this flick is certainly on my to-write list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019/09/6%20Fractured.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fractured talents&quot; title=&quot;Fractured talents&quot; /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fractured talents&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fractured&lt;/em&gt; ended around 7 PM and the Secret Screening began at 8 PM. If I left now, I’d comfortably get into Houston around 10 PM and get reasonable sleep, as I had to work at 7 AM Monday morning. “I don’t get this opportunity often though!” I told myself. “What if it’s &lt;em&gt;Joker&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Lighthouse&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Uncut Gems&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Doctor Sleep&lt;/em&gt;?!” Everyone had been throwing out guesses as to what it might be; all fairly good options! I would be so upset with myself if I left and were to later find it was a big movie. I decided: I was staying. I would leave right after the showing and get back to Houston at 1-2 AM- getting just enough sleep to barely be alive for work. YOLO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2019/09/dolemite.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Da&#39;Vine Joy Randolph as Lady Reed&quot; title=&quot;Da&#39;Vine Joy Randolph as Lady Reed&quot; /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Da&#39;Vine Joy Randolph as Lady Reed in Dolemite is my Name speaks and answers audience questions&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was happy I stayed! &lt;em&gt;Dolemite is my Name&lt;/em&gt; ended up being one of my festival favorites, highlighting an Eddie Murphy who is resilient and does not let go of his dreams- a quality many creative people like myself can often struggle with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before leaving, I was determined to get a photo with Chris Stuckmann, one of my YouTube inspirations. I looked around hoping I’d find him quickly. 15 minutes later I saw him outside; making my search time worth the wait! I snapped a photo, had a great conversation with him (really nice guy), and then jolted to my car. The night ended so perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;text-align:center;font-size:small;color:#003366;background:#D6EAF8;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2019/09/ChrisJason.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Chris Stuckmann and Jason Escamilla&quot; title=&quot;Chris Stuckmann and Jason Escamilla&quot; style=&quot;max-height:35vh;vertical-align:middle;padding:5px 5px 2px 5px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chris Stuckmann and Jason Escamilla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got home. Didn’t die. Slept. And wasn’t late for work the next day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monday---wednesday&quot;&gt;Monday - Wednesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to work was not as tiring as I thought.  However, I had Open House that Monday night (how lucky, right?!) Tuesday: Work. &lt;em&gt;Judy&lt;/em&gt; Screening. Wednesday: Work. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/articles/2019/09/28/abominable-2019&quot;&gt;Abominable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; screening. I’m a little bit sick of movies at this point. However, I decided that if I was able to get both &lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt;, two films I had really wanted to see, that I would make my way back to Austin for a one-day trip on Thursday. Gleeful, I was happy to see that I was blessed with BOTH films!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;text-align:center;font-size:small;color:#003366;background:#D6EAF8;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2019/09/Screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Assigned Parasite and Knives out!&quot; title=&quot;Assigned Parasite and Knives out!&quot; style=&quot;max-height:35vh;vertical-align:middle;padding:5px 5px 2px 5px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Assigned Parasite and Knives out!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thursday-1&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoutout to my co-worker Heather Szostek for watching my last class of the day, as I needed to leave early in order to make the 4:30 PM showing of &lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt;. It was 100% worth it. Need to give it more thought but &lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt; might just be my favorite film of 2019. Full review- coming soon! When the screening ended we were asked to exit the theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;text-align:center;font-size:small;color:#003366;background:#D6EAF8;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2019/09/BongJoonHoCinema.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Plaque commemorating Bong Joon Ho&quot; title=&quot;Plaque commemorating Bong Joon Ho&quot; style=&quot;max-height:35vh;vertical-align:middle;padding:5px 5px 2px 5px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Plaque commemorating Bong Joon Ho, solidifying the name change of the Alamo Drafthouse.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Alamo representive announced from the front of the building that Alamo Drafthouse - South Lamar would now be known as Alamo Drafthouse - Bong Joon Ho, named after the director of &lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt;. I thought that was quite interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt; time. I was assigned to theater 4 despite wanting theater 5 because director Rian Johnson would be speaking live in that theater. A couple approaches me and tells me that they are willing to give up 5 if I can give them 4 because they want to sit together. JESUS LOVES ME. I go into theater 5 and happily start to make my way to my seat. I see Sierra Preston from FonsPR who had been doing such a great job facilitating press (and a ton of other things I’m sure I have no clue about) that I gave her an encouraging comment. It put me (and I hope her) in a good mood before the film started. I was reminded to never miss an opportunity to compliment someone when you know they’ve been working hard and are doing a great job!&lt;/p&gt;

Photo credit to Adam Sanders.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt; blew me away! I will be doing a full review soon. I was impressed with how quickly and clearly they defined the characters (something I think many films with a large cast fail at; I’m looking at you, &lt;em&gt;Murder on the Orrient Express&lt;/em&gt;!) I loved the characters, the mystery, and the way it was presented. More thoughts on that soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drove home. Once again, didn’t die. And got some sleep before working a single Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this past week was very eventful (that’s a true understatement) and I had a ton of fun! This following weekend is breathtakingly energizing. I needed rest. Shoutout to everyone who worked hard at putting together a successful film festival- specifically the Alamo Drafthouse and the FonsPR team! I saw everything that piqued my interest. Despite not caring for the first few films, many of my favorite films of 2019 were seen at Fantastic Fest. If you have not attended Fantastic Fest before, I would highly recommend it!&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/archive/2019/09/2019-09-28-abominable-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Abominable is the big release this week and it’s a wonderful animated film to take the whole family to. Chloe Bennet portrays teenager Yi who one day encounters a big creature known as a Yeti. Chloe and her friends name the Yeti Everest and they venture off to return the Yeti to his home in Mount Everest, having to evade a wealthy man and a zoologist who intend to capture the beloved Yeti. Abominable features a likeable lead; Yi loves music, is highly affected by her absent father, and doesn’t give up despite adversity. At the same time, she’s a teenager and felt very real with her mom and hilarious grandma, who both argue about her teenage angst. Her two friends offer much comic relief. The villains are the weakest part of Abominable; feeling everything but real. When the Zoologist lets her hair down she looks like a ripped off Merida from Pixar’s Brave. Despite this, the protagonist and her friends are enough for me to recommend Abominable.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/09/2019-09-22-the-lodge-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;The Lodge premiered at Sundance back in January 2019, was scheduled for release this upcoming November, and then (at the time of this publication) is rescheduled for February 2020. I wish the film had kept its initial November release or only pushed it back to December, as the majority of this film takes place during Christmas time. The Lodge is not a Christmas movie by any means, but just the sheer fact that it takes place over the holidays would have been fitting if audiences could have seen this on the big screen during the same time that the movie takes place. Nonetheless, the multiple pushed back release dates have caused me to be pleasantly surprised to say that The Lodge is an above-average horror film that I would recommend you go see regardless of when it is released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A young woman named Grace (Riley Keough) and her new introverted stepchildren Aidan (Jaeden Martell) and Mia (Lia McHugh) are isolated in the family’s cabin during a cold winter season. Mysteries surrounding Grace’s past and her involvement with religion creep up and what unfolds is a mass disturbing horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s lots of elements that make you think you’ve seen this movie before. The premise reminded of The Visit: two kids going to spend time with an unfamiliar family member. The Lodge ends up going an entirely different direction and is unique enough to warrant seeing what horrors get unleashed. The soundtrack makes The Lodge also feel like other generic horrors. You have eerie crescendos (that we’ve heard dozens of times before) create tension. Fortunately, that’s about all that is similar to other scary movies. This film spares us of the annoying repetitive jumpscares that films with little substance will often overly rely on to create “scares” and, instead, The Lodge focuses on the characters, the story, and it’s awkward tension-filled moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tension in the film is often built from unusual conversations and actions between step mom Grace and the kids. However, these tense moments are often cut short due to not having an interesting way to conclude them. In one scene, young Mia is showing Grace a video she made for her dad. The video features the kids, the dad, and the kid’s birth mother having a wonderful time in the snow during a previous Christmas. As soon as birth mom Laura (Alicia Silverstone) appears on video, Grace storms out. The decision is awkward and interesting. However, the scene ends abruptly, there’s no conclusion to it, and the film moves on to the next awkward moment Grace will have with the kids. Luckily, the film eventually builds up to something more than just individual tense scenes but it does take its time getting there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the short 1 hour and 40 minute running time, you feel every minute of it. This is not a movie that is going to have ghosts popping up with a loud noise every 10 minutes. Horror fans who enjoy traditional fast-paced scares will be disappointed. The film does have an attention getting introduction that caused me to gasp and then it is a slow-meandering (yet effective) tension filled ride up until the very end, which does in fact go bonkers. Pacing can be compared to that of Hereditary; maybe a bit slower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kid’s father Ryan comes off as a bit ignorant as he must go to work and leave the kids alone with Grace. He even shows Grace how to shoot a gun and leaves it with her. This may have been an understandable choice if we, the audience, could trust Grace. The problem is that we get very little dialogue from Grace before the father decides to leave her. She comes off as cold, reserved, and unenthusiastic about being with the kids. Something that could have been done to make us not think that his character is stupid was to show us their level of intimacy; similar to what Jordan Peele did with the couple in Get Out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite pacing that asks for patience and character choices that could have been better, “The Lodge” is a unique story that has characters who mostly feel realistic and will slowly boil to a surprising finale that is sure to please those wanting an exciting experience.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/09/2019-09-21-the-death-of-dick-long-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;The Death of Dick Long was one of the best films I saw at Fantastic Fest 2019. It’s incredibly thrilling and surprisingly funny! It’s directed by Daniel Scheinert and is getting a limited release September 27th; specifically playing at Alamo Drafthouse theaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the movie begins, we learn that a man named Dick has died! His band friends Zeke (Michael Abbott Jr.) and Earl (Andre Hyland) don’t want anybody to find out how. Unfortunately, these guys royally suck at keeping this news from spreading. They must avoid the suspicion of those closest to them and the police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dGBe8xsWGlo&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie naturally will get the audience to wonder, “Well, how did Dick die?” We strategically are not shown how he died exactly or who specifically was responsible. There’s absolutely no way you will guess how he died and you won’t find out the answer here. All you can guess is that his friends seem to have maybe played a part in it as they are so scared of getting caught. When this question finally does get answered skeletons come out of the closet and it is shocking, believable, and horrid!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zeke’s wife (Virginia Newcomb) does a magnificent job at playing a concerned well-intentioned woman who is very likeable. “You want me to lie to my friend!?” she argues with Zeke. Little nuances from her character made me really not want to see her discover the startling truth that she is about to learn about someone she loves. There’s a saddening heartbreaking reaction she gives that is understandable but tragic for Zeke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comedy is successfully infused throughout the script of &lt;em&gt;The Death of Dick Long&lt;/em&gt; The dialogue that the characters deliver is clever and well-timed. I’m not typically a fan of comedy in a movie that’s supposed to be thrilling or suspenseful because that comedy seems like a writer forced it, causing the story and its characters to feel unrealistic. However, in &lt;em&gt;The Death of Dick Long&lt;/em&gt; it doesn’t feel like the writers wrote their characters to say something absurd; instead, we as the audience get to laugh at some really ridiculous lines that I could imagine these characters actually saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;text-align:center;font-size:small;color:#003366;background:#D6EAF8;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2019/09/DickLongDirector2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Director Daniel Scheinert and I at Fantastic Fest 2019&quot; title=&quot;Director Daniel Scheinert and I at Fantastic Fest 2019&quot; style=&quot;max-height:35vh;vertical-align:middle;padding:5px 5px 2px 5px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Director Daniel Scheinert and I at Fantastic Fest 2019.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zeke is not the brightest color in the box and I thought to myself, “Why are you doing this?” or “You could have avoided this if you &lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;_____ (fill in the blank)” It bothered me a little bit but because his character is written to be highly reactive and he doesn’t think his actions through, it still felt like this was all in the realm of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who wouldn’t have a good time with Dick Long? You’ll be in suspense. You’ll laugh. You’ll be shocked. Admirable script, intense climax, and pleasing conclusion. Seek this movie out!&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/09/2019-09-21-in-the-tall-grass-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In The Tall Grass&lt;/em&gt; is a horror film that releases on Netflix October 4th. It’s written and directed by Vincenzo Natali and  based on a novella by Stephen King and Joe Hill. The first act is exceptionally interesting, exciting, tension-filled, and I couldn’t help but be inquisitive as to how the story would play out. Unfortunately, the film fails to keep the heightened momentum of the attention-getting introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siblings Becky (Laysla De Oliveira) and Cal (Avery Whitted) are driving and stop on the side of a field of tall grass, as the pregnant Becky isn’t feeling well. She vomits. Before the duo can get back to driving they hear a young boy’s cry for help, saying he’s lost in the grass. This boy’s name is Tobin and he’s portrayed by Will Buie Jr. At first, it sounds as if he is really close to Becky and Cal and so Cal decides to venture in and help the child. Becky follows calling the police but quickly loses signal. Oddly, Tobin’s voice starts to sound more distant and distant and our characters begin to fear that there may be no way out of this mysterious large field. Patrick Wilson is in the movie and he plays Tobin’s father named Ross. He’s mysterious and you wonder if the characters should trust him. Harrison Gilbertson plays Becky’s baby daddy named Travis and he comes into play when he begins to wonder about Becky’s whereabouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7afc9gTbVFI&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The execution of the setup is riveting and chilly. If you hear a child crying for help, any kind-hearted person would want to go in and help. Becky and Cal are both likeable characters and the actors give convincingly well performances. Lots of times in horror, we’ve seen the writers will have our characters make stupid choices in order for them to fall into peril. I didn’t think that our characters were dumb for going into the field of grass. If I heard a child crying for help I would want to help them and this gras for some mysterious reason made it seem like the boy was just a few feet away. The film raises some interesting questions early on- like why does the grass behave in this way? Is someone behind this phenomenon or is the grass just cursed? How did it become this way? Will our characters survive? If so, how?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of answering these questions in a compelling way, the film goes in circles repeating lots of similar scenarios and it doesn’t quite make sense, as time becomes an element that the grass can alter. In the Tall Grass really reaches a disappointing point when it starts to feel inconsequential. There’s a moment you think someone is dead but then you see them alive and well minutes later. The film has its reasoning for this but I found it to be convoluted. It no longer feels grounded in reality. Instead, you’re just forced to wait for the ending to give you the answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grass can only be interesting to look at for so long. It’s interesting to imagine how this feature would have played out as a short film. Despite the fact that I was tired of looking at grass after 45 minutes, the film is beautifully shot. Colors look good. There’s some decent tension between characters fighting and the action can be a bit brutal. If the setup is enough to hook you, &lt;em&gt;In the Tall Grass&lt;/em&gt; may be worth checking out if you are really curious to discover how the story will resolve and don’t mind some bizarre answers to this mysterious tall grass.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/09/2019-09-21-ad-astra-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Ad Astra is a mysterious sci-fi adventure directed by James Gray. It stars Brad Pitt who plays an astronaut who goes on a mission to find his lost father who was assumed to be dead for several years. The film has an intriguing premise and a great performance by Pitt whose emotions are often communicated nonverbally. The single flaw with Ad Astra is the pacing- it is a slow burn and so my ultimate verdict is that if you have patience this movie is worth a ticket; it does have a satisfying final act and our protagonist has a great arc. If you get bored easily and need the plot to move along quickly, you can skip Ad Astra.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/09/2019-09-19-hustlers-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Directed by Lorene Scafaria, Hustlers is based on true events and is about a group of New York City strippers played Constance Wuu, Jeniffer Lopez, Keke Palmer, and Lili Reinhart who drug and steal from dozens of wealthy men. These characters are awful and I felt icky rooting for such vile protagonists. The  ending was underwhelmingly dissatisfying. J Lo delivers an acceptable performance but I will poop bricks if she wins an Oscar for best actress like critics at TIFF were suggesting. My favorite aspects of Hustlers are a few comedic lines of dialogue and the music; we have some classic 2000’s jams including Brittany Spears and Usher who makes a cameo appearance. Also, Cardi B and Lizzo got their names on this poster despite having very few forgettable scenes. If you’re going to Hustlers to see skin, it’s nothing better than what you could just find on Google.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/09/2019-09-17-hustlers-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Like most real exotic dancers, &lt;em&gt;Hustlers&lt;/em&gt; has a much more going on than is visible on the surface. The glitter-hazed flash of performances from enthralling actors is amped up by electric directing to deliver a thrilling ride. After you get past that sparkling exterior, though, there is a compellingly realized emotional core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/P_dfc0iqmig&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story stands out above all the other elements of the movie. What I loved here was the way the women were treated: as whole people who have agency in their lives. While the surface story of the film is about a group of women who, during the recession, have to move on from stripping to drugging lecherous men to steal from them, &lt;em&gt;Hustlers&lt;/em&gt; is really about the relationship between its main characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The play between Destiny (Constance Wu) and Ramona (Jennifer Lopez) is profoundly touching as their friendship is explored. It’s like &lt;em&gt;Thelma and Louise&lt;/em&gt; crossed with &lt;em&gt;My Girl&lt;/em&gt;, and there’s something special about any film that can tap into two friends who feel that much for each other.  It’s these moments when their humanity shines brightly even in the middle of all the shit they are buried in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to talk about Jennifer Lopez. Not because I particularly want to, she’s fine, but because she’s getting a lot of kudos for this role. I don’t know what to think about Jennifer as an actor. She has some stiffness that sort of halters some scenes, and it’s not just this film where it’s present. However, she has a natural charisma that shines bright. Say what you will, but Tom Hanks is an okay actor who stands out because he’s just so darn likable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jennifer picks excellent scripts to be a part of, though. &lt;em&gt;Hustlers&lt;/em&gt; comes just about a year after &lt;em&gt;Second Act&lt;/em&gt;, which also included a remarkable sensitivity in its writing. Is &lt;em&gt;Hustlers&lt;/em&gt; an award-winning performance for J-Lo? I’d be disappointed if it won an award. She’s good, but she’s not the best actress in the movie. I’d probably give that nod to Constance Wu, but she’s also not the lead. Jennifer is a supporting role here and she does an excellent job. All the same, though I’d love to keep seeing her pull off films like this, it’s just hard to think of her performances as being outstanding in and of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything holds &lt;em&gt;Hustlers&lt;/em&gt; back, it’s just that the story isn’t refreshing enough. It’s got some hallmark condemnation of the corruption in the marketplace that is becoming Adam McKay’s watermark. The crime drama has a very well established arc of the rise and fall of a mini-empire of greed. There’s nothing wrong with that. If anything, it’s admirable how much the positive qualities imbue this cookie-cutter template with magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hustlers&lt;/em&gt; is entertaining, wild, and beautiful. The crime is enthralling and the friendships are touching. Go watch it.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/09/2019-09-17-freaks-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Freaks is a compelling sci-fi that follows 7 year old Chloe who is played stunningly by Lexy Kolker. This little girl can act and carries most of the film. Freaks reminded me a little bit of 2015’s Room as this young girl is stuck in a dilapidated house. Her father is played by Emile Hirsh who warns her that she cannot leave the house or she will die. Hirsh’s performance is intense and both he and Kolker will easily hold your attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I love about this movie is that it successfully gets you to ask question after question as the movie progresses. You naturally wonder within the first 10 minutes, “Is this dad crazy? Is he hiding something? Or maybe danger really does exist and if so, what is it? How did it get there?” Dad tells Chloe that if she’s ever discovered she has to take on a different identity and Chloe has all of this memorized. She knows her fake address, fake parents, and it’s all extremely suspenseful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some movies will have a premise but then it becomes so convoluted to where there’s no way to guess what could actually happen because everything feels so forced or convoluted. Freaks is grounded in reality because given these Sci-Fi circumstances that you learn about it feels like realistic choices that would be made by these group of characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freaks gets us invested in the few characters it strategically focuses on and introduces us to its concepts in an engaging, suspenseful, and thrilling way. The pacing moves along quickly as there’s lots of back-to-back scenes of really interesting interactions. Bruce Dern plays an ice cream truck driver who entices Chloe into his truck– we as the audience have the thought, “Is this old man creepy and going to hurt Chloe?” The movie does a great job at getting us to guess what might happen and it subverts those expectations in a satisfying way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s some sequences that feel dream-like involving Chloe and her neighbor and Chloe and her mom– these scenes felt a little bit confusing at first, but on second viewing make a whole lot more sense. Perhaps one scene where the characters talk about why this phenomenon occurs would have solidified to audiences what was happening in those moments that initially feel confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, it’s one of my favorite movies this year and the most thrilling movie I’ve watched this year.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/09/2019-09-09-it-chapter-two-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;It Chapter Two takes place 27 years after the first It and is about the now grown up Loser’s Club who have a really bad day when Pennywise decides to return to their hometown of Derry. Mike Hanlon, the only Loser’s group member who stayed in Derry, gives each of the other members a call. All are busy with their own lives but decide to return because of the promise they made as teens which was to come back if IT ever returned. All the characters must face their deepest fears from their past in order to conquer Pennywise once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for effective and creepy jumpscares, IT Chapter 2 should satisfy your desire for a lengthy creepy haunted-house feel of a film. If you’re searching for a compelling story along the lines of Get Out or Hereditary you unfortunately won’t find it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some scares are predictable but nonetheless have a drastic shift from quiet to loud volume- this caused me to flinch in my seat a few times and in that vein, the sound design and timing of these creepy noises was striking. The make-up and special effects for some of the supernatural horror sequences was visually pleasing. It Chapter Two is brutal, gory, and has some kills that will may make you cringe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Character development is attempted but unfortunately never reaches a level that evokes true emotion. Effort was put into giving each character attention but it felt extremely formulaic. After the group arrives in Derry we focus on individual characters one at a time and to really understand each person’s pain we cut to flashbacks of their past that reflect some of their current fears. It follows this pattern for every. Single. Loser. There’s little surprise, it feels contrived, and I couldn’t latch on to any particular character. No one felt relatable. Each of their own sequences just seems like it’s purpose is to have some dark jumpscare moment at the end of it. And if you’re into that then like I said earlier, you will be happy with this film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Character development is attempted but unfortunately never reaches a level that evokes true emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Bill Hader, Isaiah Mustafa, Jay Ryan, James Ransone, and Andy Bean portray the adult versions of the Losers Club- and they all do fine. I particularly liked Bill Hader as Richie who had a lot of effective comedy written for his character which he delivers well on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would think with a 2 hour and 49 minute running time that there would be a complex narrative but there isn’t. The story is very thin, merely focusing on its scares.
If you simply want a good horror film and don’t care too much about the conclusion to this series, I would recommend Ready or Not– which has your jumpscares but is also faster-paced and primarily focuses on a single protagonist which made me feel more connected to a character more than this did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you must know what happens to our group of losers and will be fine with a small story full of jumpscares- then I would recommend it to you and think you’ll be happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/archive/2019/09/2019-09-05-brittany-runs-a-marathon-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;I found myself deeply moved by &lt;em&gt;Brittany Runs a Marathon&lt;/em&gt;. The sensitivity with which writer/director Paul Downs Colaizzo captured the pain of the main character resonated deeply with my personal experiences. Though it has issues with pacing, structure, and an unwieldy title, &lt;em&gt;Brittany Runs a Marathon&lt;/em&gt; stands out how well the film connected with me on an emotional level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ks_HSj1UqKI&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is unique here is the way the story and acting harmonize together. &lt;em&gt;Brittany Runs a Marathon&lt;/em&gt; touches on feelings of helplessness, lack-of-direction, self-doubt with a piercing voice. While the main theme is viewed through the lens of body-image and weight-loss, the struggle with how to deal with yourself is what the film is truly about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It stands out when the performance of Jillian Bell as Brittany blends with the narrative to pull you inside of her head. Her depth of character spans so much pain that it would be difficult to be unable to identify with her. When the flow of writing blends with the emotion of Jillian’s acting, the film sucker punches you in the gut by having Brittany lash out at those around her. The punches hurt all the more because her deepest criticisms come from her hatred of herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these strengths, the film struggles with pacing. It lingers too long after we already get the idea some times and other times its metaphors are too on-the-nose. From a construction standpoint, &lt;em&gt;Brittany Runs a Marathon&lt;/em&gt; would have benefited from a more aggressive soundtrack and emphatic sound design. Both of these elements come off as deeply utilitarian and forgettable. They’re not bad, but they fail to give the movie the amount of texture it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of these flaws, I loved it. I was moved to tears more than once and laughed out loud several times. That type of emotional connection is priceless. Those elements are so broadly appealing that this is an easy film to recommend. For most people, &lt;em&gt;Brittany Runs a Marathon&lt;/em&gt; will be very good. For a few of you, this is going to be a special film that you’ll remember for a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

The film follows the duo as Jack attempts to save his niece from her future– which is his past and it’s very confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Don’t Let Go is unique and creative but does an amateur job at executing a compelling or polished thriller.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think getting a phone call from a passed loved one is admittingly shocking. The setup is effective as we see the close relationship that Jack and his niece have. Unfortunately, the story is slow, communicated terribly, and feels inconsequential. Don’t Let Go is unique and creative but does an amateur job at executing a compelling or polished thriller.&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/archive/2019/09/2019-09-03-unbelievable-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Unbelievable was created by Susannah Grant and will be available for streaming starting September 13th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unbelievable is an extremely compelling suspenseful drama based on a true story. It stars Kaitlyn Dever who most recently did an A+ job in Booksmart- and she once again does a terrific job at portraying a teenager named Marie Adler who is charged with lying about being raped. It’s based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning article called “An Unbelievable Story of Rape,” where Marie tells authorities that she is raped but then proceeds to retract her statements multiple times, after the police pressure her when they find her report to be suspicious. I won’t delve into anymore details in case you have not read the article and want to find out what happens by watching this show which I do recommend you check out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The series is extremely fast-faced and gets to the point quickly. The first scene involves a cop questioning Marie about the rape incident after it was reported. I liked that we are immediately thrown into crucial circumstances. The following scenes are all distinctly engaging and interesting; you learn that Marie grew up in a series of foster homes, craves attention, and the show gives enough reasoning as to why the police might have had their doubts about Marie’s rape story. I won’t spoil  specific details but by the end of episode 1 I myself was conflicted with what actually happened for a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This show is very suspenseful as you begin to piece the information that unfolds together. It hardly has moments that drag as the scenes are often captivating if not due to the suspense, due to all the great character moments and the script which is well-written. Most of the dialogue reflects the characters personalities which are very well-defined, interesting and mesh well with all of the other characters in the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, all the actresses are a huge highlight; Kaitlyn Dever does a great job at balancing irresponsible teenage angst while also making the audience empathetic towards the circumstances she’s in. Merritt Weaver and Toni Collette as detectives investigating rape crimes compliment each other tremendously well as they have contrasting personalities. Weaver plays Detective Karen Duvall who is a faith filled investigator who follows protocol and is a lot less abrasive than Collete’s character, detective Grace Rasmussen (Ras-muh-sin). Rasmuhsin is a verterran detective who has a bold, unfiltered, and get-it-done achiever personality and can sometimes come off as rude. Both detectives are very different but extremely interesting to watch work together. I felt like they had good chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I initially wondered how this story would keep the pace up over the course of 8 episodes but the story actually goes beyond the scope of Marie. For the majority of the show, detective Duval and Ras-muh-sin are investigating a series of other rape crimes. We slowly start to see how these rapes collide with Marie’s and what these lead detectives discover is astonishingly Unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sound design is interestingly raw for several conversations but it knows when to be eerie and creepy for suspenseful or dramatic scenes. The cinematography is gorgeous; it’s well shot and color corrected in a very aesthetically pleasing way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show is well-knit together. Small conundrums are the fact that the police are very non empathetic and insensitive when initially interviewing Marie. They don’t say, “I’m so sorry this happened to you” or “We apologize for making you explain this multiple times but it’ll help us immensely”. They’re just robotically asking question after question about the rape. They’re not very comfortable questions either- like they ask “Did you get raped vaginally, anally or both?” These robotically asked questions seemed like they were written this way solely so we could dislike the cops and not to reflect real circumstances. I could be totally wrong and maybe this is just police protocol but it’s something that felt contrived to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no problem with the doubts that the police have involving Marie’s story, as the show provides enough legitimate reasoning as to why they doubt her. Totally wrong of them to pressure Marie the way that they do but the show presents it in a way that is heart-breakingly believable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing that felt contrived and seemed like it was done to just to build dislike and animosity towards characters was Marie’s friends almost all sending her hate messages after it goes public that she apparently fabricated the story. I so badly wanted Marie to explain to someone the legitimate reasons as to why she felt like she had to change her story. Instead she just sobs as all her friends dissipate from her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion which I will not spoil was satisfying. You could probably think of more extreme twists and turns they could have taken but the show decides to stick to its source material and display true events which I appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately you should invest the time into watching this unbelievable compelling miniseries, which sheds light on a remarkable true story and also gets us to ask about interrogating procedures police use with their victims.&lt;/p&gt;

She’s told the night of her wedding she has to play a game with her in-laws if she wishes to become a part of the hard-to-please family. Eager to begin playing, the game quickly turns violent! Lots of people are going to enjoy Ready or not- the premise is intriguing, the acting is terrific, and is quick paced. While I typically prefer a full-on horror movie, comedy is mixed in undeniably well. This should please those who want some lighthearted moments to ease the tension. The ending is a bit underwhelming and not too surprising but the journey to get there is fun, unique, and entertaining. I give Ready or Not a B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was worried that this humor would be overly relying on the 3 main characters doing inappropriate things. Fortunately, these Good Boys are genuinely ignorant as to what they are getting involved in. The fact that they don’t realize what is happening is consistently amusing. The characters are likable. The humor can be a little repetitive but the 90 minute fast-paced run time is sure to keep the audience laughing in this humorous feel-good flick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directed by Lulu Wang, The Farewell is about a Chinese family whose grandmother is diagnosed with cancer and has a short time left to live. Her immediate family decides not to tell her about this dark news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Farewell is informative of Chinese customs, very dramatic, and surprisingly very comedic despite the heavy subject matter. The pacing can be slow at times despite it’s short 98 minute running time but I still recommend you check it out! Bring your Kleenix to this heartwarming feel good flick!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Dog’s Journey part 7 is directed by Simon Curtis and tells about the life of Enzo the dog who is voiced by Kevin Costner. This movie tells how his owner Denny gets Enzo, how he meets a woman he loves, begins a family, and the role Enzo play a part in this family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The art of racing in the rain has many heart-warming moments but lacks a plot that builds. Instead, it’s just cute dog moments. And for some of you who love watching pets do cute things, that may be enough to warrant going to go check this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s some funny parts involving Enzo not being fond of Denny’s significant love interest, Eve. There’s sentimental moments involving marriage and a family getting started. But it all seems so close to things you’d see a normal family go through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real life is often times not nearly as interesting as movies and that’s why I like to go to the movies– to see out of the ordinary or intriguing situations play out. The art of racing in the rain feels way to simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a scene where Eve forgets to feed Enzo. He starts hallucinating and an animated scene with a zebra unfolds that was completely unfunny and did not blend well with the real life elements of this film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s not any real conflict that lingers until the very end. It involves Eve’s parents but by that point I was ready for the film to rap up.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/08/2019-08-10-dora-and-the-lost-city-of-gold-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Dora, played by Isabella Moner, is an Explorer who was raised in the jungle and for the first time is going to high school and she’s made fun of because of how she sings and dances just like in the cartoon. This conflict was funny because everyone else is acting how you would expect high school kids to act and at the same time, this may connect with kids who feel made fun of because of how different they may be from their peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This live version makes fun of how Dora asks questions to the audience just like in the cartoon. When Dora looks into the camera and ask the audience a question, her parents actually say “Oh, she’ll outgrow that”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie begins with a young Dora and her cousin Diego as very close explorers who get along. When Diego moves to the city at a young age he gets used to the city life and is embarrassed of his cousin who still likes to sing the “Backpack” song as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought seeing an adult actress playing such a pee-wee herman character would be cringy but because everyone else also sees it as a little weird, I was fine with it because they play it off that she is weird because she never grew up around city kids and it all felt realistic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, her cousin Diego and friends are thrown into an adventure to save Dora’s parents and this is where it all becomes very predictable and silly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The antagonist is weak, the twist is underwhelming, and the adventure itself lacks any real excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obstacles are easily overcome as Dora seems to know how to solve every challenge that comes their way; figuring things out that the audience would have had no way of guessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, there is a lack of real danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a recommendation for families with kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dwayne Johnson and Jason Stathom reprise their roles as Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw who are two guys who don’t get along at all. They are forced to work together when Hobb’s friend Locke, hilariously played by Ryan Reynolds, informs Hobbs about a cyborg-like threat played by Idris Elba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leads dislike and animosity towards each other is consistently comedic. Hobbs pokes fun at what he calls Shaw’s Harry Potter accent and Shaw makes fun of the Rock’s face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production and special effects are mostly top notch. Everything is shot and color corrected beautifully. However, there is an embarrassingly huge continuity error where the scene changes from night to day time instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s so many unimaginable moments where characters lives are at risk and it just takes me out of the story when these characters choose to say something snappy and quippy in the midst of danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idris Elba’s villain is a cliche antagonist whose ludacris motive makes no sense. He literally introduces himself as the “bad guy” and wants to wipe out our characters for no believable reason. While he’s literally referred to as the Terminator, he lacks depth that the Terminator from T2 actually did have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final act is long drawn out and could’ve easily ended at an earlier point in the film. There’s two encounters the heroes have with the antagonist and the only reason the screenplay called for that second encounter was to beef up the villain and add a ton of Hobb’s family members that were easily forgettable. Had the film tweaked a few things about the plot and wrapped up at the first encounter this easily could have been 1 hour and 45 minutes. Instead we have to sit for 2 hours and 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s some decent action scenes; my favorite involving the characters going down a very tall building. However, there’s nothing like John Wick that’s truly unique or jaw-dropping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s plots relating to Hobb’s daughter and a romance he has with Vanessa Kirby’s character that don’t truly get a satisfying conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/archive/2019/07/2019-07-30-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&lt;/em&gt; walks the line between deep and dumb like a tightrope. In this slow-burn, character-driven piece, Quentin Tarantino explores the end of the golden years of Hollywood. Despite the heady material, though, it lacks narrative drive as it meanders around while pushing the plot into the background and may bore those who aren’t invested in the stars behind the late ’50s and ’60s tinsel town magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Just be warned that the film moves slowly and when it bursts into action the violence is brutal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The directing is on point as Tarantino has easily produced one of his most finely crafted films. He doesn’t have a large directing filmography, but it is one with a high bar. The pacing and tone are uneven, though. Patient viewers will love the careful build of tension from scene to scene; but, even for me, it felt slow and the tone changes came off as extreme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ELeMaP8EPAA&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My feels get complicated because I cannot outright call these elements flawed.  These are clear stylistic choices that have a meaningful effect, and they are in character for Tarantino’s work, so many viewers will be completely prepared to live with… or even outright enjoy the style. Just be warned that the film moves slowly and when it bursts into action the violence is brutal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the pure construction of the film, the music and acting are both absolutely on point. There’s not a single person who drops the ball here, but both Leonardo DiCaprio (as Rick Dalton) and Brad Pitt (as Cliff Booth) deliver outstanding performances. Each of them gives a performance that gets you completely invested in their character. From moment to moment you cannot help but care about where they’re going and what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing is clever, I’m just not entirely sure how smart it is. Tarantino is saying something with this film, but it’s difficult to say exactly what that is or whether or not it’s meaningful. Most of the entertainment to be had is from the wit of the dialog as the story itself lacks momentum. Tarantino even seems to be aware that he’s created characters that are more interesting than the story as he pushes the major plot elements into the background. The story sort of gently unfolds until it blossoms in the last five minutes or so, but it does so with so much violence that I was put off of the climax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the movie lacks a journey home after it peaks and ends without any sense of returning home. After it all, I’m not entirely sure if the film is profoundly deep or deceptively shallow. It certainly feels like it has something to say, but I’ve been fooled before. Be warned that how you appreciate the movie will depend heavily on how much you know about it before going in, so I would highly recommend not reading or watching anything about the plot of the movie that isn’t in the trailers before seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most audiences will be torn over the pacing and tone. If you’re prepared for a nice slow burn with just one or two intensely violent and thoroughly brutal peaks, then you’ll love &lt;em&gt;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&lt;/em&gt;’s clever writing, talented acting, and compelling music. That said, I think a lot of people will struggle with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/07/2019-07-29-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Review Transcript&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s 1969 in Los Angeles. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt take on the roles of television actor Rick Dalton and his stunt double Cliff Booth respectively. The two best friends are striving to achieve success and fame in the film industry. We see them have a number of interactions with people and unfortunately many scenes feel pointless as the plot is all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite not having an immediate compelling narrative, there are some great comedic moments sparsed throughout the film, one of my favorites involving a fight between Bruce Lee and Brad Pitt’s character. Another involving DiCaprio beating himself over his alcoholism and forgetting his lines. Not surprisingly, everything is well-acted due to the A-list cast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production is topnotch; “Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood” truly feels like it took place in the 60s. From the sets, the cars, and even the film used to shoot the movie- detail was paid close attention to .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the longer I payed attention the more I kept asking, “Where is this going?” The film does not have a focal point and instead there are a ton of subplots or scenes that in hindsight you ask “Did this need to be in the movie?”. It feels like a TV series with episodes that do not always connect with each other, some parts are better than others. This may not bother you. There is some good writing and well-directed scenes scattered through the film- but for me when I am investing this much time I want to see a movie that builds the longer we watch it. We start the film wondering about Dalton who struggles with alcohol issues, there’s a rumor that Booth killed his wife, Booth gets into a fight with Bruce Lee, Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate is completely wasted in yet another subplot that was meaningless. In the end, the payoff which is in the last few minutes of the final act was not worth sitting through 2 hours and 40 minutes of film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst all of these plot details, Tarantino wastes our time showing us more than what needs to be shown. There’s shots of people driving listening to music and instead of starting when people start talking we see them for no reason listening to music or just looking around. A shorter cut could possibly have won me over. Tarintino did have final cut privilege with this film and so his stamp of approval was on this edited version and I thought it was a task to sit through.&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/archive/2019/07/2019-07-11-the-lion-king-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;The Lion King is directed by Jon Favreau, who directed the Jungle Book, and has much to love about it! The plot is the same as the original and in case you’ve been living under a rock: Mufasa voiced once again by James Earl Jones is king of the Pride Lands and is raising his young son Simba to one day be King. Uncle Scar played by Chiwetel Ejiofor wants to take over the Kingdom and in order to do so he must betray Mufasa which eventually forces Simba into exile where he meets friends Timon and Pumba, hilariously voiced by Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The voice acting is tremendous. Young Simba and Nala voiced by JD McCrary and Shahadi Wright Joseph are adorably portrayed. The two cubs sing I just can’t wait to be king which sounds great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donald Glover and Beyonce play grown up Simba and Nala and the highlight song is easily Can You Feel the Love Tonight? The two harmonize beautifully together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people will have a good time watching this 2019 rendering.The animation is great, the music is wonderful, and it is recommendation for those who love The Lion King or even for anyone who finds this story to be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not think this is better than the animated movie. It could be because I’ve seen that movies hundreds of times that nostalgia is convincing me that it’s better but I have two main reasons that I’d like to discuss as to why the Animation is better than this photorealistic remake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A story about Lions who can talk, sing, and dance lends itself to an animated movie because cartoons have the luxury of being exaggerated because they’re not aiming to look and feel like real life. With this movie, the animation is so advanced it mirrors reality and anything that doesn’t look real could have come off as cringe-worthy. Luckily, everything does look real but the unfortunate aspect is that there’s some sequences that are more well pulled off in the cartoon version because they could afford to do some really extreme things with its characters that added to what made that movie so magical. For example, Be Prepared is shortened in this movie because Hyenas walking the way that they do in the cartoon would look silly. The visuals are breathtaking but lack those ultra saturated greens, blues, and pinks often seen throughout the animated version. Additionally, I just can’t wait to be king sounds great but has the ability to be a whole lot more epic as a cartoon as you have more animals intertwined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second reason I like the animation more is it is tighter on the pacing. The cartoon is an hour and a half whereas this new version is 2 hours. I don’t mind them adding things. There’s an extra scene with Nala leaving Pride Rock to find Simba and there’s a scene with Timone and Pumba having a conversation with Simba about their beliefs about the Circle of Life. They’re not bad scenes at all; they’re honestly fine but as someone who’s seen the classic I personally prefer a shorter film that gets to the point faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, I do very much enjoy both versions of The Lion King but I did want to explain two specific reasons why I personally prefer the animated over this. I do not regret seeing this. It was a ton of fun. Even if the original is better, it was amazing to see all the attention to detail that was put into the ambitious attempt to making this movie come alive.&lt;/p&gt;

The first 3 or 4 episodes you may be a little underwhelmed by the level of problems that are being dealt with. I felt like these first few episodes were really good but I have heard the complaint that it is slow and I disagree. They communicate a lot that I thought was interesting really fast as we have 13 main characters at this point and they needed to give each one an adequate enough screen time so you can see how they&amp;rsquo;ve changed since the last season. I defend the decision for the Duffer Brothers to spend so much time on the characters because that is why this show is so good- Stranger Things always shows our characters doing things we can relate to and it is when it does that, the characters feel very real and extremely fleshed out. Several SciFi movies and TV shows can often get lost in the SciFi and forget about building good characters- but Stranger Things keeps the characters a priority and I loved what they do with them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Dustin, Steve, a new character named Robin, and Lucas&amp;rsquo;s sister Erika are trying to decrypt a Russian message that leads them to uncover a conspiracy that coincidently connects to the main plot. Joyce is grieving the loss of her previous love, Bob. As I mentioned, Hopper is trying to figure out how to be a dad and I liked how concerned he was because it really showed how good of a father figure he is. Him and Joyce investigate a weird situation involving magnets. Nancy and Jonathan are investigating a series of rats that are acting peculiar. While trying to get the story published, they face opposition from their co-workers who all think it&amp;rsquo;s a silly story.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If you&amp;rsquo;re in a group of 3-5 you get more chances to talk then if it&amp;rsquo;s a big giant group of 13 people. Also, the environment changes consistently as we cut from each group which made it feel like a lot was going on and it was a nice visual change to look forward to. One moment we are at the pool, the next we are in a forest, and the next the mall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

From episode 1, &amp;ldquo;Suzie, Do You Copy?&amp;rdquo; we are left to wonder if Dustin&amp;rsquo;s girlfriend is real. In the last episode, it turns out she is real! I thought it was hilarious that Suzie really did exist since everyone including myself thought she was fake.

I was really surprised and at the same time sad for Steve Harrington who grew close to Robin this season. I think we all really wanted to see them get together. In fact, if any character was going to say they were gay I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be Will Byers who is upset that Mike and Lucas are so interested in girls. He just wants to play D&amp;amp;D with his &amp;ldquo;buddies&amp;rdquo; like the good ol&amp;rsquo; days. Mike snaps at him saying, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not my fault you don&amp;rsquo;t like girls!&amp;rdquo; Will doesn&amp;rsquo;t defend himself and it could just be he hasn&amp;rsquo;t reached the point where he is interested in girls like his friends or it could be The Duffer Brothers hinting that season 4 may explore his sexuality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The fact that Steve has yet to find his happy ending is still on the search makes him feel like a real character. In addition, I hope Robin can find someone she really likes!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That&amp;rsquo;s something that is specific to the July 4th Holiday and release time of the season. It was such a unique way to battle against a monster. How many other shows or movies do you know have fireworks being used as a weapon? This form of attack was original and beautiful to look at.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This moment created lots of tension because El has been the trump card helping out a ton this season. Particularly I like when she helps trap Billy inside the Sauna. That reminded me of a scene from an old X-Files video game. I also like when she goes psycho and uses her powers to rip pieces of The Mind Flare a part. Having El lose her powers was a smart decision because it made the end unpredictable as we all would think that El would be used to finish off the antagonist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

His death was entirely unexpected, shocking, and devastating. I like how his sacrifice is what ultimately saves our group because after El loses her powers I did not have any idea what would finish off The Mind Flare. As cute as the fireworks were to weaken the monster, we knew that wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to defeat the creature. It&amp;rsquo;d be too easy. A theory I had was maybe the characters we met last season who also have powers like Eleven would show up and help overthrow the monster but I&amp;rsquo;m glad that did not happen because there would&amp;rsquo;ve been no emotional impact with that choice. I think the screenplay made the best decision possible regarding the ending. There have been some people angry with Suzie saying Hopper would have had more time to get back to Joyce had she not had to sing the song. That&amp;rsquo;s debatable but I can understand everyone&amp;rsquo;s frustrations. I&amp;rsquo;m sure Hopper would be gone song or no song as this is what the showrunners wanted moving forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When El is reading the letter that Hopper had written to talk to her I lost it. It was so sad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine anyone else being behind that door and Stranger Things is very intentional with their script and for that to never be addressed wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I predict Joyce will have moved on and potentially find someone she likes. When it is discovered that Hopper is alive, this could create some tension-filled conflict. I think Mike and El are going to be dealing with long-distance relationship issues. I also think this next season may be released around Thanksgiving time since that&amp;rsquo;s when Mike says him and El will for sure see each other next time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixar once again proves they are able to create a film both kids and adults will enjoy. Toy Story 4 is heartfelt, comedic, and overall an entertaining and engaging experience. I love the themes and the lessons our main characters learn along the way. There’s questions asked about purpose, letting go of the past, accepting who you are, and so much more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directed by Josh Cooley in his directorial debut, Woody voiced by Tom Hanks and all of our other favorite toys face difficulty when Bonnie’s new crafted toy, Forky wants nothing more than to be left in the trash. The toys consistently keep trying to prevent him from throwing himself away as this new toy is Bonnie’s favorite. The adventure centers around Woody and lots of new characters in an antique shop who slow Woody and Forky down from getting back to Bonnie. Bo Peep, her sheep, and new friends assist Woody on yet another exciting and emotionally-filled journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Woody’s movie. There’s several new characters that are fun but Woody is the character you are rooting for and he’s the most likeable that he’s ever been. His classic stubbornness and persistence is something I personally admire and there’s a lot of resilience that his character has. In fact, there’s one saddening scene where no one believes in Woody’s plan due to multiple times the plan has not gone very well, but he still doesn’t give up and persists at completing his mission. I am extremely drawn to characters who are so passionate about doing something that they feel is right even if that means that they might break a few rules along the way. This is why I liked Miguel from Coco so much and Woody is that way in this feature. I think this characteristic is a good one to have kids watch as they can learn that if their first attempt doesn’t work out, it is important to never give up, be creative, and continue to pursue goals you set for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see the maturity Woody has undergone since the first movie when it comes to how he deals with not getting attention and feeling lonely. Bonnie does not consider Woody a favorite toy, as he is often forgotten about. Wherein the first Toy Story Woody is purposefully trying to get Buzz lost and verbally takes his anger out on him, in this film Woody will stop at nothing to ensure the safety of Forky because he realizes how much joy Forky brings to Bonnie and he’s come to terms, as painful as it might be, that he’s not the favorite anymore. However, he can still have purpose and that’s what he pursues. I think that’s such a complex issue that feels very real, hits you emotionally, and is great to see that change throughout this saga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more depth given to Bo Peep. The movie actually begins with a flashback 9 years prior to the present and we finally learned what happened to her and when you see her in the present you understand what she has endured and why she is the way that she is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The antagonist is a classic doll named Gabby Gabby who has a believable motive an Alive-Toy might have and one of the saddest scenes involves something that happens to her near the end. A film that allows you to feel bad for the character causing havoc to the main characters has definitely done something right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie has new Characters Ducky and Bunnie voiced byKey and Peele and also Doom Kaboom voiced by John Wick or Kieanu Reeves, same thing. These characters are good comic relief characters and they get plenty of screen time. However, I did wish we could have seen more of our classic characters. We don’t see Buzz, Rex, Slinky, and Mr.MrsPotato Heads as often as you’d think. They get time on screen but the film opts to have these newer characters get screen time and while what they do with them definitely works, as someone who is a long-term fan of the series I would’ve preferred if some of the old characters had more time on screen. At the same time, I can see the argument that it would have been cluttered and Pixar choosing to focus on the new ones allows more time to add depth to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is emotionally stinging and I will not spoil what it is, but it is fitting, displays growth in our main character, and I can’t wait to talk about it more once all of you have had the chance to watch it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the ending of the video review above for my rankings/grades of all other Toy Story movies in the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/06/2019-06-16-dark-phoenix-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Review&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dark Phoenix, the final installment in the main X-men film series. It’s directed by Simon Kinberg in his directorial debut; although he is not new to the material as he was a writer for many of the previous X-Men movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’ll definitely be helpful if you’ve seen previous X-Men films in regards to being familiar with the characters but if you haven’t this is not a movie where you will be completely lost the entire time. Certain character decisions and choices may not make as much sense but you should be able to logically follow the story and that was one thing I appreciated; the story is very simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The X-Men venture into outer space to save the lives of other humans whose ship is in distress. Jean uses her abilities to save the last person on the ship but in doing so absorbs a mysterious force that causes her to go crazy out of control. We then learn about Jean’s past, secrets that have been kept from her, and sit and wonder how the X-Men will respond to Jean’s actions. There’s also a villain shoved into all of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two acts of this movie are engaging and hit the beats that movies should hit. There’s an unexpected attention-getting story that I was moved by involving Jean and her parents. This setup allowed me to like Jean. Sophie Turner does a fine job portraying this character. When she ventures out into space, risking her life to save, her likability continues to go up.
Lastly, there’s a big secret that James McAvoy’s character, Charles Xavier, has kept from Jean. I won’t spoil what it is but this kept secret is what sets Jean off and I liked that the way this conflict unfolds. The notion that the trailer gave off was that this thing in outer space just makes her evil and that’s not all that interesting. Instead, this encounter in space makes Jean extremely overpowered and easily irritable. And once she learns about something that Charles Xavier has done, chaos erupts and when you find out what it is- you will completely understand why she feels the way that she does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is for these reasons that, despite the havoc she causes later on in the film, Jean Grey is a mostly likeable character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, James McAvoy’s character is also likeable and understood. You also understand why he did what he did. Director Kinberg stated that he wanted characters to feel like they all had a “valid point of view” and I think he accomplishes this mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie’s fine setup sinks when the villain, played by Jessica Chastain, arrives. I really enjoy Jessica Chastain as an actress but unfortunately the writers did not add the depth they gave to their established group of characters to this antagonist, who has the most forgettable and contrived motive. I believe she wants to use the Dark Phoenix powers that Jean has in order to resurrect her species. We do not get any scenes seeing this species die out and or any prior interaction that Chastain has with them. Therefore, there was not a strong reason to get behind what this villain is doing and just feels like a nameless bad person. In fact, I actually don’t even remember if this villain has a name. I really think she might not. The wikipedia just calls her a shapeshifter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finale in this film is not even a fraction of the epic explosiveness that Avengers: Endgame recently pulled off– and while I was not expecting that big of a final battle, I was extremely underwhelmed with how poor the final fight is. You think that there should be more. There was very little creativity put into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie should have either not used the villain and kept the conflict among it’s main established characters or taken more time to develop the villain that I did not care about at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a finale to the series, the resolution is underwhelming and too safe. However, the first two acts’ quick pacing and character choices allow “Dark Phoenix” to fall fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/06/2019-06-13-men-in-black-international-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;It feels downright good to see a return to form for the &lt;em&gt;Men in Black&lt;/em&gt; franchise as &lt;em&gt;Men in Black: International&lt;/em&gt; delivers the sequel that the original always deserved. Though it never escalates above a pure popcorn flick, audiences will still enjoy a refreshingly light experience all the way through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BV-WEb2oxLk&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original &lt;em&gt;Men in Black&lt;/em&gt; took the world by storm with its outside-of-the-box perspective suited up in a wild sense of style. It’s probably not quite as good as you remember, but it’s still pretty fresh. Despite this, the original film does still hold up because of its highly structured narrative filled with entertaining performances. The sequels, despite their merits, never quite recaptured that. They focused so heavily on the sense of novelty and the superficial identity that the core composition was neglected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Men in Black: International&lt;/em&gt; has its flaws. It starts strong with a unique set of characters and flows well. The chemistry between Tessa Thompson and Chris Hemsworth has already been proven, so it’s no surprise that they work well and prop the film up even when the narrative falters a little bit here and there. There are a few scenes where the pacing dips which are noticeable even when the result is fluid. It isn’t necessarily &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; when the film stalls as it gives both the audience and characters room to breathe, just off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the most effective tool that masks the awkwardness that the film has around its character moments is Kumail Nanjiani’s performance as supporting character Pawny. Kumail is rarely so on point with every line of dialog as he is in &lt;em&gt;Men in Black: International&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The element that holds the film back from being more than a summer popcorn flick is just that it isn’t really about anything.  Not that it lacks a character arc or a solid villain, but these elements never work in concert. This is probably the one thing that the original film did better. There is just something magical when the themes of a story work in harmony with all of the other structural elements, and that just never quite happens here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed &lt;em&gt;Men in Black: International&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a fantastic ride that I think anyone who ever had any love for the franchise will appreciate. While I wish there were something deeper here, I’m happy to enjoy this series again. This won’t change the world, but if you are in the mood for a light and refreshing way to spend a lazy summer afternoon, there isn’t a much better way to go right now.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/06/2019-06-13-5b-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;The struggle to bring human connection to the lives of those who are suffering is so profoundly powerful that I would be surprised if you could watch &lt;em&gt;5B&lt;/em&gt; without being affected. Despite flaws in pacing and structure, &lt;em&gt;5B&lt;/em&gt; triumphantly documents the work of people who showed the finest love and bravery in the middle of a global crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/48m65zguIdc&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its face, &lt;em&gt;5B&lt;/em&gt; is about the very first designated ward for treating HIV/AIDS patients in the United States. Beginning with the early signs of the epidemic and continuing through modern day, &lt;em&gt;5B&lt;/em&gt; follows the lives of the nurses and doctors who provided more than just advocacy to the victims of the disease. They provided human touch. They provided compassion and dignity. In the face of a plague that no one understood, these heroes refused to allow people to die scared and alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By providing an emotional connection from the early days of fear, prejudice, and discrimination to where we are today, &lt;em&gt;5B&lt;/em&gt; ends up ultimately being a story about us. It’s about how we as a society have changed. It touches on the culture wars of information through the government and media. The importance of visibility when you’re struggling for understanding or even basic recognition. What is most profound here, is that &lt;em&gt;5B&lt;/em&gt; highlights the parallels between the communities hit hardest and with how society addressed the sick as a whole. While the film is most heartwarming when it captures the compassion of physical touch, it is at its most thought-provoking when it explores how we, as a country, conflated AIDS with the community it ravaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though generally well executed, the film does struggle with pacing and structure. It often revisits portions of the narrative out of context. Given the context of the film and how well the subject matter resonated with me, I never felt as though the structural issues broke the immersion into the documentary, but they definitely hurt it. These moments were occasionally noticeable enough that it did feel like I was simply re-watching earlier chunks of the film, which is a bit disorienting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I recommend &lt;em&gt;5B&lt;/em&gt;. It documents a touchstone in our society that had such wide-ranging effects that it touched everyone in some way. But, what is more essential than the importance of the material is how it made me feel. &lt;em&gt;5B&lt;/em&gt; is a moving work of art through history that is worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/06/2019-06-09-dark-phoenix-2019.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;A vast improvement over &lt;em&gt;X-Men: Apocalypse&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dark Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; gets enough right that it is almost worth overlooking its sins. Don’t get me wrong, there is plenty broken here. The villains are disposable, the plot twists and turns without purpose, and the action scenes, filled with continuity errors, aimlessly drift along. Despite all of this, &lt;em&gt;Dark Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; manages to succeed by exploring the story through the character Jean Grey’s perspective and by finally having some moments where the X-Men as a whole just feel like they should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/azvR__GRQic&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; is set after the events of &lt;em&gt;X-Men: Apocalypse&lt;/em&gt;. The X-Men have reached a level of normalcy in their universe. After finally developing a routine wherein they are on call to save the day, the president of the United States reaches out to them when the latest emergency arises with the curent space shuttle mission. While on this latest mission in space, Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) is exposed to cosmic forces that radically affect her powers. The effects on her character call into question whether or not she may remain a force of good as they also cast a shadow on the past actions of Professor X (James McAvoy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very real flaws with the construction of &lt;em&gt;Dark Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; are tied to its structure.  Individual action scenes are composed of clips that frequently lose sight of the layout of the environment. It is impossible to meaningfully track the exact events as they relate to each other in the moment-to-moment cuts. The intensity and length of these scenes are fine though their lack of clarity makes them feel hollow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a larger scale, the film introduces aliens that have no real context in either the universe or even in this story. The stakes they introduce are poorly explored at best and shallow at worst. I kid you not, they could have been cut from the entire movie and it would only have affected a few fight scenes. I couldn’t tell you what they were called without looking it up or even a single one of their names. Even the characters that we care about flip-flop back and forth as they change motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Simon Kinberg doesn’t abandon any plotlines, he resolves them with such abruptness as to feel like they might as well have just been dropped off. The real shame is that all the worst parts are in the last half ending &lt;em&gt;Dark Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; on a sour note after a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that start is really good. &lt;em&gt;Dark Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; deserves a great deal of credit for finally feeling like a fun and adventurous X-Men movie for the first 30 minutes. They get called by the president, go to space, just flat out save people without any greater context of poisonous human-mutant relations. It’s flat out entertaining. Even after they get back, the struggle between Jean Grey and Professor X is meaningful and gets the core ideas right. There’s a fantastic exploration of what it means to be robbed of agency by people with good intentions and to be constantly told who you’re supposed to be by the people who wronged you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first third of the runtime had me feeling genuinely hyped for what may have been the best X-Men movie yet. Overall, I think those things worked well enough and delivered something so rarely felt in this franchise that I think the movie is worth it. Just go in with tempered expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/archive/2019/05/2019-05-30-godzilla-king-of-the-monsters.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;How do you even make a sequel to both &lt;em&gt;Godzilla&lt;/em&gt; (2014) and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/articles/2017/03/08/kong-skull-island-2017&quot;&gt;Kong: Skull Island&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; given how different those films were? &lt;em&gt;Godzilla: King of the Monsters&lt;/em&gt; answers this question by keeping everything that works and cranking the monsters up to 11, and that isn’t a bad answer at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFxN2oDKk0E&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what exactly is it that works? Massive world-building, thought-provoking narrative, and intense-but-short giant-monster fights! &lt;em&gt;King of the Monsters&lt;/em&gt; really excels where the vast majority of sequels fail by diving headfirst into the logical conclusions of its predecessors. We are immediately introduced to an Earth that is covered in Titans that are waiting to be released and reshape the entire cinematic universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t go back to the way things were. You change everything and shift the nature of the setting to embrace the premise. This is something that I’ve been wanting &lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt; to do for over 20 years, but they keep just rebuilding the park and telling the same story. In &lt;em&gt;King of the Monsters&lt;/em&gt; it is refreshing to see that everything that came before now built up to something and get rewarded with that kind of insanity. There are monsters &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt; and they are glorious!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this radical worldbuilding, &lt;em&gt;King of the Monsters&lt;/em&gt; also follows up on &lt;em&gt;Skull Island&lt;/em&gt;’s willingness to say something. Godzilla films have historically framed the monster as a metaphor for national traumas. &lt;em&gt;Skull Island&lt;/em&gt; dug hard into the lasting psychological damage of Vietnam on the American thought process. &lt;em&gt;King of the Monsters&lt;/em&gt; reframes Godzilla to a more modern American trauma and it asks two very interesting things: How do western cultures see their trauma differently from eastern countries and can you move forward as a culture by learning to make peace with the cause of your trauma?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I don’t think &lt;em&gt;King of the Monsters&lt;/em&gt; addresses its questions as elegantly or as well as &lt;em&gt;Skull Island&lt;/em&gt; did. While they’re there, and I give points to that, the focus has shifted more to the Titans. For a lot of people, that will probably work, but for me, I think this sets the film back just a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;King of the Monsters&lt;/em&gt; puts its philosophy just behind the main event: the fights. And oh-my-god, the fights… they are glorious! Director Michael Dougherty uses the clashing of its titans as punctuation. These monsters crash together in violent outbursts that tie together the story effectively without overpowering the story. I have so much respect for a director who appropriately paces their action so that it is used to move the story forward rather halt it for visual indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much fun as I had, though, it did feel something was missing. Maybe it was the slightly less effective use of its themes or possibly that &lt;em&gt;King of the Monsters&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t push the boundaries narratively in the same way that &lt;em&gt;Skull Island&lt;/em&gt; did. Either way, I did leave the theater wishing that there were just a little something more and feeling slightly unfulfilled. I don’t think this will bother most viewers, it was slight and difficult to enumerate, but palpable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has already been a crowded blockbuster-filled summer, but despite that &lt;em&gt;Godzilla: King of the Monsters&lt;/em&gt; stands out. If you liked &lt;em&gt;Skull Island&lt;/em&gt;, or haven’t given the franchise a chance since the 2014 film, &lt;em&gt;King of the Monsters&lt;/em&gt; is worth watching and will likely stick with you for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/05/2019-05-29-ma.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ma is a psychological horror thriller directed by Tate Taylor (&lt;i&gt;The Help, Get on Up, The Girl on the Train&lt;/i&gt;) and stars the outstanding Octavia Spencer who portrays a lonely adult woman named Sue Ann, who becomes crazy obsessed with a group of teenagers after agreeing to buy the teens alcohol. Sue Ann is coined the nickname Ma after letting the kids use her basement as a place to party. Ma only has a few rules, the main one being not to go upstairs. The movie has some terrific suspenseful secrets unfold as you learn that this odd woman who enjoys the company of youngsters is not who she truly appears to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film does a great job at keeping the audience’s attention by quickly putting the typical party kids in a weird situation that works out for them but it makes us, the audience, wonder, “Why in the world would this wacko lady let these teenagers do a bunch of illegal things in her home? Does Ma really just want friends? Or is there something more to this peculiar woman? If so, what is it? And what is Ma hiding upstairs?” Ma does what any great suspense movie should do by answering each question it poses with an interesting answer but yet poses another question to keep you on your toes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The storytelling is creative as it doesn’t just play out from beginning to end. We dig into Sue Ann’s past through flashbacks which are extremely effective with communicating big ideas that explain why Ma is the way that she is and you understand her bizarre character very well.
There isn’t a standout actor amongst the teenage group but each one plays their part convincingly well. The true star is not surprisingly Octavia Spencer. She is one of those few people who is always really fun to watch perform. From her voice, her mannerisms, facial expressions- Octavia Spencer’s weird character is brought to life by the natural abilities of the talented actress.
Comedy is surprisingly fused throughout the entire screenplay and it hits almost every time. There’s several movies that don’t blend horror and comedy very well. Often times the comedy diffuses the tension or the particular jokes are not very funny. Ma is funny and at the correct times. There isn’t many moments of peril where the thrill is ruined by a misplaced joke. We don’t get a hard unpleasant break on the thrills and shoved into laughs we weren’t looking for. Instead, the film sleekly and smoothly eases between these tones creating a fun roller coaster of feelings to experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie has a lot to reveal. While the trailer does say a lot about the setup of the film, there is a lot of substance to uncover that was satisfyingly interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some character choices that are very idiotic, especially considering something that Ma does in front of the kids very early on which would have freaked me out- kidding or not kidding- I was surprised with how easy they choose to continue to go back to her house despite her early actions. It’s somewhat forgiving as the film doesn’t portray these teens as the brightest colors in the box. While the film is engaging, some character choices seem to happen simply out of shock value. While effective, the choices seem a bit unrealistic at times, especially the finale that definitely gets heated near the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, I 100% recommend that you go check out this movie, as it successfully delivers suspense through a mesmerizing performance by Octavia Spencer and features a fun screenplay that creatively tells an intriguing story.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/05/2019-05-24-aladdin.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aladdin is a movie that is very easy for it to not work. It should not work as a live action movie. You have so many things that could very easily look absurd! It’s challenging to pull off because you have so much magical elements throughout the entire story that are hard to make look right. You have a genie, a flying carpet, a cave that erupts, talking animals, crazy fast paced songs that require immense energetic choreography- almost any scene in this movie is no easy task to direct. Luckily, the film is brought to life by an astounding production design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney is not cheap at all- they really value Aladdin, it’s one of their renaissance era babies and you can tell that they did not care how much it cost to make this thing look right- there is so much CGI and typically that can be a bad thing but it is integrated so beautifully well with the live-action that it is honestly eye candy to see Agrabah come to life. The production design and special effects are commendable and are a big reason why Aladdin works so smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case for whatever reason you don’t know the plot of this movie, Aladdin, portrayed by Meenuh Muh-sood, falls in love with Princess Jasmine, played by Naomi Scott. However, he’s conflicted as the Princess can only marry a prince. By using a magical genie whose Will Smith, Aladdin goes on an exciting adventure where he learns about being true to who you are. Marwan Kenzari is Antagonist Jafar who tries to steal the lamp from Aladdin in order to rule the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aladdin has the same heart as the original- however, it is not a shot-for-shot remake. In an interview, Guy Ritchie explains that if there was an area they thought they could improve upon they would do that; if not, they would leave it alone. One big change made is introducing the audience to Jasmine a lot sooner than the cartoon, in fact we see the two interact right before Aladdin’s first song “One Jump Ahead”- I did like this change because it gave us more time to see Aladdin and Jasmine interact before “falling in love”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of One Jump Ahead, this was probably the hardest song to pull off in terms of choreography because Aladdin is supposed to be running and singing at the same time. It looks very staged but once again going from cartoon to live-action, this was an expected challenge and I think that it’s fine overall. You get the point of what is happening and they included the classic song that fans want to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the music- Friend Like Me is the CGI spectacle similar to Be Our Guest and Will Smith does great as genie. He looks as fine as I think you can make a genie look in real life.
Prince Ali is another song that is impressive as the studio had over 1,000 dancers on this set. When you watch that scene it is no mere copy and pasting people. There are a ton of humans putting their entire heart into making this pretty outrageous song work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Whole New World is beautiful but not as quite gripping as the animation where that was actually my favorite song. In this, I’m going to say Friend Like Me was my favorite due to the immense amount of effects and Will Smith’s vocals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember how the new song from the live-action Beauty and the Beast went? Neither do I. There’s a new uncatchy and forgettable song sung by Naomi Scott called Speechless that should have been cut. It wasn’t catchy whatsoever and ate away at the long over 2 hour running time. This film did not need to be more than two hours and it’s all due to the mediocre additions that have no large effect on the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a new character whose a friend to Jasmine named Dahlia that I did not care too much for but her ultimate purpose (which I will not spoil) was fitting and gave a nicer conclusion to one of the other characters in the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some cheesy lines and actions that take place in this movie and if you aren’t forgiving this might bother you more than it did myself- to me, this is a children’s fantasy movie that is expected to have some things that sound and look a bit weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think kids will be wildly entertained by the fast paced fantasy plot and adults who grew up with Aladdin like myself will admire the attempt to bring a classic to life. If you weren’t a fan of the original, this movie is not changing your mind and you can skip it altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I did thoroughly enjoy the 2019 take on Aladdin the 1992 classic will always be my favorite. It’s shorter, a bit tighter on the pacing, Robin Williams performance is unmatched despite me really enjoying Will Smith, and the cartoon makes the silly lines feel less weird because the fully animated medium reminds you that it’s a kids’ movie. Maybe the live action is better and I’m just being nostalgic but I truly do think a classic will always be better than a reimagining of that classic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aladdin is a spectacular family fantasy movie that both kids and adults who loved the classic will admire the production efforts put into reimagining this ambitious fairytale.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/05/2019-05-23-brightburn.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightburn is essentially a horror twist on the origin story of Superman. Tori (Elizabeth Banks) and Kyle Breyer (David Denman) are unable to conceive children but one day a meteor falls from the sky containing a baby. The couple adopts the baby naming him Brandon and years later Brandon decides to make some horrific choices discovering that he has supernatural abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed the way that the movie started. The main character’s struggle to get pregnant is relatable to several people. I have known people that want children but due to medical reasons, they can’t. This causes the audience to feel sympathy for these parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, a big bag of horror cliches is what truly falls from that sky because as soon as we see Brandon, or Brightburn, start making use of his powers this movie becomes awful rather quickly.
Brandon causes a series of terrible events without a motive that is satisfying. He’s a teenage kid acting out and that’s really fun to watch for so long. Thus, after the intriguing setup is finished, we are forced to watch an unlikeable main antagonist cause havoc. I think this movie would have been more emotional and complex if there was a better motive or reasoning for Brandon’s actions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s two very unique disturbing scenes, one involving a piece of glass and an eye and another scene that graphically shows the outcome of a crazy car incident on one of the character’s mouth. The cosmetic work in this scene was grippingly grotesque and it should satisfy horror fans who are looking for something unique. Unfortunately, outside of those two scenes, the rest of the horror comes from cheap repetitive jump scares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several character choices feel fake. There’s a character who gets Brandon, whose 14, a hunting gun without even asking his parents. I can’t fathom who would think that’s okay. There’s a girl in Brandon’s class that acts incredibly awkward and her performance is very forced. Tori, the wife character, doesn’t believe her husband Kyle at one point when he is trying to explain to her something really weird that he experienced. All of these little details causes the story to not be taken too seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brightburn has an interesting sounding premise but the mostly all cheap jump scares and fake character choices prevent the little substance from being taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/05/2019-05-21-booksmart.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Booksmart is a comedy directed by Olivia Wilde and stars Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein as overachieving high school seniors Amy and Molly. For their entire academic lives, they have never gone out and partied because they were so focused on getting good grades so they can get into good colleges. Molly has an outraged epiphany when she discovers that all the kids who had fun, didn’t study at all, and partied, also got into good colleges. On the last day of school, her and Amy are determined to have the night of their lives to make up for fun times that they missed out on and to prove to their classmates that they truly aren’t just booksmart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can’t relate to the main characters’ over-the-top OCD perfectionist attitude, you’ll be sure to find both characters to be very likeable and interesting. They’re well-defined, are unique, and quirkishly funny. We want to see them accomplish their mission for the night, which proves to be a lot harder than it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situations that the girls find themselves in are wildly entertaining and it held my attention from beginning to end. The girls are specifically trying to get to Amy’s crush but they can’t figure out where the party’s at. The pacing of the film moves briskly, as the girls move from party to party coming up against so many comedic obstacles. From bumping into a party no one else showed up to, to getting an Uber ride who turns out to be their principal- there’s so many outrageous situations that despite being over-the-top at times, the characters’ intentions and dialogue made me smile throughout each scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script is clever, hilarious, and heartfelt. There’s scenes where you laugh and scenes where you truly feel the character’s pain. As I mentioned, Booksmart does have some silly over-the-top moments that cause you to have a little suspension of disbelief, but because the characters and dialogue is so entertaining, it’s easy to overlook and still recommend the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Booksmart is the best movie of 2019 so far. Funny, heartfelt, and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

If you’ve already bought into this franchise and didn’t care too much for the icky feelings that the last one left you with, &lt;em&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/em&gt; will wipe that away with an unapologetically shallow thrill ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pU8-7BX9uxs&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not split hairs. The action is better, the entertainment was better, and director Chad Stahelski has upped their game in every single capacity. What stands out as unique here over the previous chapters is a solid sense of humor and comedic timing woven into the choreography. I laughed more than I have through the entire franchise. It’s worth noting that while there is less substance here than the predecessors I enjoyed the ride more than I have thought I would, and that humor brought a sense of freshness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, though, there is less substance here. Where &lt;em&gt;John Wick&lt;/em&gt; gave us the first peek into the universe of The Continental and &lt;em&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/em&gt; fleshed it out deeply through the eyes of a John Wick with depth and pathos as we learn that he himself may crave the destruction he brings on himself, &lt;em&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/em&gt; just kind of… meanders through the stuff we already know. We get a few new characters and so many action scenes that run so long that they might as well never actually stop, but the plot walks back any character development that Wick himself had and the only new world building we get is some new characters that don’t add a whole lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This won’t diminish the film for most, but I was personally a little sad. Part of the charm of flicks like these is also in how rare they are… or were. I remember being completely enchanted by &lt;em&gt;Shoot ‘Em Up&lt;/em&gt; in 2007, the first movie that captured that pure adrenaline vibe. 7 years passed before the original &lt;em&gt;John Wick&lt;/em&gt; captured that feeling again, where there were almost more bullets than words spoken. But since 2014 there have been 3 of these, now. Walking back that character development makes it a little less special, and it was already that for being a sequel. Incremental improvements in technical proficiency and quality of film making can make up for a lot of that, but not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another element that I’ve appreciated so far has been how this series has made use of great actors to fill in every little crevice of the world. And, the first crack appears in that bit of armor, too. Several of the cameos work beautifully. Mark Dacascos is electrically entertaining opposite Keanu Reeves, Asia Kate Dillon is chilling, and I will always love every time Anjelica Huston appears anywhere. However, Halle Berry delivers a wooden performance that mostly serves to spill out exposition every time she opens her mouth, usually things we already know as an audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the tone shifts will mean those who liked the original may enjoy the third a little bit more, viewers who crave more meat will be disappointed by the backslide. Even still, &lt;em&gt;John Wick: Chapter 3: Parabellum&lt;/em&gt; is a technical achievement that is a lot of fun to watch that could be more.&lt;/p&gt;

I know what you’re thinking, that sounds awful; but, don’t worry, &lt;em&gt;El Chicano&lt;/em&gt; is just regular bad. With weak acting, bland writing, and just generally boring pacing the film wastes its opportunities to be anything interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/r0Ymh8arZwk&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For everything terrible you could say about the deeply problematic premise of &lt;em&gt;El Chicano&lt;/em&gt;, I think diving too deeply into the poorly thought out authoritarian ideas it explores is a waste of time. Yes, it’s about a police-sanctioned killer murdering criminals without trial, and sure that’s &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, but it’s just so boring that I could barely care. Honestly, I don’t know how you can take a story about a man taking on the mantle of a supernatural vigilante killer and distill it down to something so snooze-worthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s not like this comes from a place of complete incompetence on the part of director Ben Hernandez Bray. There are quite a few moments where Ben captures some interesting perspectives with the camera, but they’re so flat and lifeless that you couldn’t be blamed for missing it. The first time El Chicano makes an appearance in the film the camera shows his actions from two sides as he physically divides the protagonist and antagonist. It’s a clever use of physical space as a metaphor for the emotional division of the characters that is completely wasted on this melatonin pill of a film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real achievement of &lt;em&gt;El Chicano&lt;/em&gt; is managing to pick out the mildest Chicano art I have ever seen. We’re talking about a culture with some of the most beautiful and colorful works of art in North America, blended with an intense historical background of struggle in both Mexico and America that is drowning in identity and Ben put a couple of low rent Aztec icons in the background of some frames. It’s such an amazing task that it’s almost applaudable if you can keep your eyes open long enough to appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t possibly recommend &lt;em&gt;El Chicano&lt;/em&gt; to anyone unless you’re just desperate for low rent &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/articles/2018/09/06/peppermint&quot;&gt;Peppermint&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. There is potentially appeal on the grounds of representation for everyone who ever watched a vigilante serial killer and wanted to see themselves in those shoes. I cannot deny the enticing power of getting heroes that you can physically identify with. As people, we’re hard-wired for that kind of validation. Or, I guess… if you really need help sleeping. But there has to be a better movie for even that.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/05/2019-05-08-tolkien.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Tolkien, directed by Dome Karukoski, is an average biopic that is sure to bore you to death if you’re not already eager to go in and want to learn about The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings author, J.R.R. Tolkien.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film follows John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, (Nicholas Holt) and shows us a glimpse into this author’s past friendships, schooling, love of languages, and his romantic interest, Edith Bratt (Lily Collins).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karukoski knows how to film a beautiful movie that truly feels like it took place during the World War I Era. There’s no Starbucks cups that make their way on this set. The acting is well done, as Holt and Collins carry the film and are brilliant actors who have good chemistry with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason why I dislike Tolkien is because the film covers so many different facets of this author’s life, and none of those aspects did anything to engage or intrigue me. If this was a movie about J.K. Rowling, an author who I already personally adore, I’ll admit that I might have enjoyed something like this slightly more. As someone who did not care for the content, it did nothing to draw me in. There’s nothing super extraordinary that happens to inspire an indifferent audience member to become emotionally invested in the calm phlegmatic story. The film is targeted specifically to those audiences who are already curious about what Tolkien went through before becoming a famous author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get past the stoic premise and tune in, the film is effectively informative and you will learn a lot about Tolkien’s past friendship and love for Edith. While it failed to entertain, it successfully educated and I could now go write a paper on Tolkien’s life if instructed to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have liked to see more interesting conflict. It could be argued that they couldn’t make anything up because it’s based on a true story. However, I would add that by keeping the story strictly informative, they sacrifice losing a large audience who may have enjoyed a more creative story. Although, they probably would have lost an audience who wanted exactly what this movie is- a factual narrative. If you want to know the true details of Tolkien’s life, this film will satisfy your desire to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/05/2019-05-07-the-intruder.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you just need pure schlock entertainment to fill your eye holes and &lt;em&gt;The Intruder&lt;/em&gt; is some of the best you can get. The special recipe here is a story that firmly walks the line of setting clear expectations while putting extra thought into developing the character conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aKXvex7b1Ew&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after getting a big promotion at work, Scott (Portrayed by Michael Ealy) and Annie Russell  (Meagan Good) decide to move out from the inner city to a countryside home to begin working on family life. Unfortunately, not everything is copacetic in the Russell home as marital strain wears away at their relationship that is both mirrored and exacerbated by the antics of Charlie (Dennis Quaid) the prior owner of their house who becomes increasingly obsessive. Fans of pulp suspense thrillers will be familiar with the beats but may be pleasantly surprised by the rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two core elements that really work well in &lt;em&gt;The Intruder&lt;/em&gt;. The first is the way it approaches the perspectives of both Scott and Annie as it divides them over Charlie’s character. Some of the poor character decisions that are common in the genre get some thoughtful reasoning here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensitive viewers may catch the subtext that is built into the film as a realistic relationship is revealed between Scott and Annie through their ordeal. It’s pleasantly surprising to have so much thought into fracturing the male and female perspectives. Director Deon Taylor has created a split where you could follow along with either character all throughout the rising tension of the story. I’d like to say more but really can’t without spoilers, but it was awesome to come out of the theater and be able to talk about what these characters have going on in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That second element is the magic of a completely over-the-top bonkers performance from Dennis Quaid. Deon Taylor has fun with the perspective as it paints Charlie (Quaid) sympathetically through the first half of the film before letting him run off the deep end. I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that for most of the film his performance inspired laughs. It’s gloriously entertaining. But when things need to get chilly, they do as Qaid is able to turn that manic performance into something coldly unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few elements do detract from the experience. Ealy and Good are competent enough through most scenes but lack the chemistry to feel organic when they need to. It’s rare and most audiences probably won’t notice it, though. I was also a little disappointed in the music. Honestly, neither of these things undercut the experience, but they were areas that could have been polished to shine more intensely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a fan of cheesy thrillers then you’ll have a blast with &lt;em&gt;The Intruder&lt;/em&gt;. It’s about the most fun you’ll have watching a psycho stalk their victims all summer.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/05/2019-05-06-pokémon-detective-pikachu.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Movie Review of Pokémon: Detective Pikachu by Jason Escamilla. Starring Ryan Reynolds, Justice Smith, Kathryn Newton, Suki Waterhouse, Omar Chaparro, Chris Geere, Ken Watanabe and Bill Nighy. Directed by Rob Letterman. #PokemonDetectivePikachu #DetectivePikachu #DetectivePikachuReview&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Review Transcript&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved pokemon growing up. I played the video games and the card game. Unfortunately, this movie was boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Goodman, portrayed by Justice Smith, is told that his father is involved in a fatal accident and is missing. While at his father’s apartment, Tim teams up with the adorable Detective Pikachu, voiced by Ryan Reynolds. Together, they venture throughout Ryme City, which is place where Pokemon and Humans live peacefully with one another, in order to uncover the mystery behind Tim’s dad’s disappearance- learning about some shocking truths along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kids who love Pokemon are probably really going to like this movie. There’s enough iconic Pokemon in the movie to get their attention and the plot is easy to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as an adult I was not entertained. It really feels like an average Saturday morning cartoon where you don’t usually get an emotional punch or real suspense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a few times where this movie goes for an emotional hit and the reason why it doesn’t work is because it is relying on the fact that you really care about Tim and his father Harry’s relationship, which I didn’t. The two were not very close and there’s never a moment where you see the two interacting, with the exception of flashbacks (and there’s a reason why that I won’t spoil) but I really think that it ruined us developing a desire for these two characters to find each other. Because it didn’t feel like they were close, I found the main mystery to be underwhelming and a bit boring. The film should have started out with us seeing them bond and give us a reason to care that his dad is missing. If they fixed this, his dad would have felt like a real person we wanted to see come back and the bond between them would have felt more real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The antagonist’s motive was so silly it is forgettable and the twist with this character feels like a cliche Saturday morning cartoon. There’s a twist with Tim’s dad is that I was not expecting but I don’t think it saved the film from the main plot being unengaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the script suffers from lackluster comedy that did not make me laugh too much. While I think Ryan Reynolds is hilarious, there wasn’t any memorable big laugh-out-loud moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best compliment I can give to Detective Pikachu is the visuals. They are admittingly beautiful. Pikachu is very cute, as you would expect. The neon lit city is aesthetically pleasing to look at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audience’s inner child may enjoy an adventure that’s equivalently as exciting as a Saturday morning cartoon. Those looking for substance will be bored by an underwhelming plot.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/05/2019-05-05-hellboy.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Littered with heavy-handed exposition, filled with bad acting, and fractured by an overly ambitious narrative, &lt;em&gt;Hellboy&lt;/em&gt; is some of the most fun I’ve had all year. Almost as though it were specifically created to break systems like that of Rotten Tomatoes, &lt;em&gt;Hellboy&lt;/em&gt; is a bad movie that is an absolute blast to watch, which makes it difficult to quantify. Because, what does it really mean to be a bad movie?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZsBO4b3tyZg&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the previous films in this franchise, you would be totally justified in needing to know exactly what &lt;em&gt;Hellboy&lt;/em&gt; (2019) &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, especially since the answer to that question is something that’s a little ballsy. &lt;em&gt;Hellboy&lt;/em&gt; is a reboot of the franchise that represents a separate continuity from the previous installments but jumps headfirst into the depths of the title character’s world as though it were a sequel. It’s a strange experience to see something that both strives to be completely new but allows you to carry over your expectations from alternate versions. This isn’t quite a unique approach to continuity. &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Homecoming&lt;/em&gt; did exactly this only just last year by resetting the character while deliberately omitting all the story elements that have been seen before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creators are loath to take this approach for fear of confusing their audience. It &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt; here, but it is so mixed in with the issues that I believe that this element will be perceived to be one of the core flaws rather than among its strengths. So, what exactly are the problems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right from the beginning &lt;em&gt;Hellboy&lt;/em&gt; sets the overall tone with a flashback narrated by an explanatory voiceover from Ian McShane as Professor Broom. All the ingredients are bland: the text itself is derivative, Ian McShane sounds bored, the effects are cheesy, and they tell so much of the story that they have to leave tons of holes leaving the ideas incomplete. Everything wrong with the first 30 seconds is emblematic of the poor craftsmanship that plagues the rest of the runtime… but…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all of that, there’s a little bit of attitude there. Some totally unnecessary F-bombs. Off-handedly casual incorporation of underutilized mythology from around the world starts to creep around the edges. The music picks up. But, when it feels like they’re pulling the &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; music thing with great classic rock, except poorly like when &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt; did it, they kick it up with original arrangements that freshen up the vibe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every bone in my body screamed that I should be hating all of this, but by the time that Hellboy shows up there is just something fun happening. And for everything else wrong here, the writers, cast, and crew &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; Hellboy as a character. Before I know it I’m rocking out in the theater, hyped, and excited for what’s coming next. And not just the character of Hellboy, but other whole elements of the &lt;em&gt;Hellboy&lt;/em&gt; anthology that have only been done well in the comics. The portrayal of the Baba-Yaga (an incredibly unique Russian witch that lives in a house that walks around on chicken legs played here by Troy James and Emma Tate) is outstanding. She passes off as creepy while adding loads to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything has been cranked up to 11 by the end of the film and I’m finally seeing a movie that’s not afraid to throw some B-movie style gore around to take the R rating. It’s cheap, silly, over-the-top silly gore that is like an 80’s sci-fi re-imagined… and &lt;a href=&quot;https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/c12e5a62-bc06-4baa-a307-26f551259412&quot;&gt;I LOVE it&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a large body of people who like bad movies, which may cause you to ask if &lt;em&gt;Hellboy&lt;/em&gt; is so much fun because it is bad. It absolutely is not. Its imperfections are without a doubt opportunities to have been a better movie. &lt;em&gt;Hellboy&lt;/em&gt; is fun because of the things it does right and I only wish I could have seen a version of this movie that had tried harder to polish its edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The things that &lt;em&gt;Hellboy&lt;/em&gt; gets right are refreshingly unique. You just can’t find this type of over the top excess anywhere else. Many of these characters omitted from previous films capture the real essence of the source material. Hellboy himself gets explored in ways he hasn’t quite been explored before. For everything broken here, &lt;em&gt;Hellboy&lt;/em&gt; gets so much right that I believe that it will ultimately become a cult classic for the things it accomplishes which the majority of critics have dismissed. This is a weird beautiful gem in spite of all of the cracks running through it.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/05/2019-05-03-uglydolls.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UglyDolls&lt;/em&gt; feels wrong to not like, as it has a message about loving yourself and appreciating the differences in one another. However, this standard run-of-the-mill throw-away animation is boring due its uncreative storytelling that feels like something that would be seen on Nick Jr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzbxSpBOJ6E&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An UglyDoll named Moxy (Kelly Clarkson) wishes to venture outside the borders of Uglyville, a town where oddly shaped plush dolls exist with one another, hoping to find a human child whom she can bring joy. One day, her and her group of friends stumble upon The Institute of Perfection, where human-like dolls compete in a series of tests, known as the Gauntlet, in order to be placed with a human child. Leader Lou (Nick Jonas) initially rejects the UglyDolls participation, but Moxy’s eagerness and optimism changes his mind. However, Lou will do everything possible to stack the odds against our main characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary issue with &lt;em&gt;UglyDolls&lt;/em&gt; is that it doesn’t do anything to get the audience to think or wonder. There’s no suspense because you should be able to figure out how the story will end. There’s no emotional reason for wanting to watch because the characters, while likeable (if you don’t find their over-optimism to be annoying), don’t feel relatable, but contrived. The drama is not creative enough to genuinely take interest in what might happen. Subpar is the one word to describe various elements of the animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world where Pixar exists, it is difficult to not mention how bland this film looks. &lt;em&gt;UglyDolls&lt;/em&gt; is STXEntertainment’s first animated film to be produced and while it is not unwatchable, it is not nearly as aesthetically pleasing to look at as the eye-candy visuals that Disney has spoiled us with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generic pop music sung by an ensemble of known musicians (clearly for marketing purposes) has a couple of catchy tunes, but nothing that stood out or made me run to Spotify to add to my everyday playlist. Several songs sound familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be argued that this is a kid’s movie and that it does not need to be that deep. However, we’ve seen several films released that have appealed to both older and younger audiences. This film might only mildly appeal to very young children and if you want them to see an approving message on self-worth, it might be worth taking them. Be forewarned: It’s lucky that there was only a short hour and thirty minutes to sit through, as I spent almost every one of those minutes waiting for it to end. While &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/2019/05/06/pokémon-detective-pikachu&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;POKÉMON: Detective Pikachu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (releases May 10th) has its own set of issues, I’d recommend that over this; sheerly due to the effort Pikachu puts into its plot elements, which make it slightly more entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the film was about to end, several families including their kids began to exit the theatre that I saw this in, which affirmed my belief that audiences will be ready to leave by the time, or even before, the film ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Long Shot is directed by Jonathan Levine and stars Seth Rogan as an uncompromisable and strongly opinionated journalist named Fred who begins dating his former babysitter Charlotte, played by Charlize Theron, who is running to be the President of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise was as interesting as it sounds and I liked the contrast between the two main characters. They have interesting chemestry, they’re comedic, and unusual but it was all in the realm of things that could potentially happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t find all the humor to mowork but I thought a good amount of it was decent and it held my attention as the film unravels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also liked how the film presents the true problem that well-known people have of upholding a good public image. The beginning of the film shows Theron’s character being told that she is doing well in her public image overall but needs to work on her humor. As the plot unfolds, there’s certain decisions that she makes in order to avoid her public image being tainted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an unrealistic decision that some politicians make towards the end. It involves them blackmailing characters and it took me out of the story for a moment as it felt way too unrealistic, as blackmailing would ruin their public image as well.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, those moments are too few and far between and the rest of the film is a mess. Not painfully so, as the biggest crime of &lt;em&gt;Fast Color&lt;/em&gt; is putting the audience to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/se9n853lBNo&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to like what director Julia Hart has put together. &lt;em&gt;Fast Color&lt;/em&gt; is a movie about the beautiful power inside of women of color and how you can be so amazing while still being completely helpless. This is a richly metaphorical work of art that has moments which satisfyingly feels like it was reaching for something deeply personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there just isn’t enough linking this powerful metaphor for personal beauty and power to a meaningful narrative. This isn’t inherently a problem by itself, but &lt;em&gt;Fast Color&lt;/em&gt; establishes a narrative framework that leaves its audience expecting a measure of grounding to the storytelling. The result is a story that feels surprisingly lost with characters that are directionless, resulting in a film that fails to resolve while feeling like it should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few small moments where the film’s narrative and metaphorical flows resonate together into something like an outstanding color-drenched music video from another time. For all of its other failings, I loved how I felt during these moments, but they were too rare to overcome the flaws that left me feeling bored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cast does a well enough job in the film and the music is passable. These are two areas that could have really served to elevate the style, but they range from mediocre to just mildly enjoyable. They never add to the experience, only prop it up. After the movie was over, none of the supporting elements of the film stuck with me at all as I forgot the music and most of the actors as I walked out of the theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Fast Color&lt;/em&gt; is a unique film that may find a home with people who particularly crave its emotional message, most will be turned off by the lack of direction or general skill in its execution. I honestly wish I had been able to enjoy it more. I wish that it had given eloquent housing to the important ideas that reside within it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jumpscares- the movie- is directed by Michael Chaves and follows every horror tactic you’ve ever seen without offering anything to the genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anna Garcia played by Linda Cardellini is a social worker in 1970s Los Angeles, who quickly learns that La Llorona is haunting her kids shortly after this spooky weeping widow murders two other children that were tied to a case Anna was working on. The movie is spent primarily in Anna’s home with the kids and Raymond Cruz who plays an ex-priest named Rafael attempting to rid the connection La Llorona has with the family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For his first feature film, Michael Chavez knows how to execute horror sequences. The timing, music, and jumpscares mostly work. There’s a few laugh-out-loud moments that I’m not sure if they were intended, but nonetheless these eerie scenes were done in a way that I found to be interestingly entertaining but fairly standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is almost non-existent after the setup because once we know who this evil widow is, we go into the jumpscare sequences. And if you like that, you will probably have a fun time with this movie. However if you’re looking for a compelling story with fleshed out characters, The Curse of La Llorona is not that film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate to be too harsh because I can tell some effort was put into giving Cardellini’s character some depth. We learn early on that the husband is not around and I would’ve wanted the film to explore that and Anna’s past more intricately. There’s also some interesting characteristics about Raymond who we learn has given up on the church but still has faith in God. Very interesting ideas that could’ve made me care about these characters more but instead, don’t go further than what I just described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this film taking place in The Conjuring Universe, you don’t have to be familiar with the Conjuring universe to understand it. That connection could’ve been excluded entirely and it seems it was added at the last moment in order to get Conjuring fans to buy tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s lots of moments where you’ll wonder WHY IS THIS CHARACTER CHOOSING TO DO THIS OR DO THAT?! For example, when La Llorona first makes contact with Anna’s kids, they get burned on their wrists and I thought WHY DO THE KIDS NOT TELL THEIR MOM? She even asks what’s wrong and her son tells her NOTHING I WAS JUST IMAGINING THINGS. When the mom notices the burns, I felt like she should have pressed further with how these kids got these burns. There’s a scene where they have all successfully trapped La Llorona outside but the daughter decides to go outside for a worthless doll. If I know my life is at risk, the last thing I’m going to care about is a doll and I would be concerned with being as far away from this evil entity as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did like that this movie was quick-paced and the 1 hour and 33 minute length does go by quick. If you’re really in the mood for a horror film at the theatre, I think this was more entertaining than Pet Sematary but not as creative or good as Us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main curse of La Llorona is that it doesn’t offer anything to to the horror genre, relying on jumpscares to carry a paperthin plot intertwined with Latin folklore.&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/archive/2019/04/2019-04-10-little.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Obligatory pun: &lt;em&gt;Little&lt;/em&gt; is a treat that packs big laughs into a small package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dk6jGQXx3o0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kid, but &lt;em&gt;Little&lt;/em&gt; is sincerely an early lead for the most entertaining comedy of the year. It’s more than just funny, though, as &lt;em&gt;Little&lt;/em&gt; has just a bit more going on than your average &lt;em&gt;Freaky Friday&lt;/em&gt; clone. In &lt;em&gt;Little&lt;/em&gt;, Jordan Sanders starts life as an idealistic warm-hearted little girl who has her hope bullied out of her. She takes that model of abuse and decides to grow up to be so big and mean that no one will be able to bully her as she will always bully them first. Sure enough, she allows this to shadow her entire life until she’s reverted back into the body of a child and forced to relive her adolescent pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a  refreshing take on body transformation as more than just a learning experience for the character, but rather a metaphor for the mental state that reflects the arrested development that Jordan has suffered from through her whole life. I walked out of the film reflecting on the ways that my childhood impacted who I am as an adult, and… that is pretty special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acting is what pushes &lt;em&gt;Little&lt;/em&gt; over the top, though. Marsai Martin steals the show as 13-year-old Jordan Sanders. She struggles here and there with keeping the scene together; but, when it counts, she is hitting her delivery home. Her role is also sandwiched by some of the most fun I’ve ever seen Regina Hall have. She dives headfirst into the evil witch role and packs every scene with aggressive energy that is only possible with the type of playful fantasy that &lt;em&gt;Little&lt;/em&gt; tries to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wouldn’t be fair to highlight great performances without also talking about Issa Rae’s turn as Jordan’s assistant and co-star April Williams. She plays beat for beat off of both Marsai and Regina, pushing her scenes into some gut-busting laughs territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weakest elements of &lt;em&gt;Little&lt;/em&gt; go hand in hand with its strengths. The story is a tiny bit thin and I was more than once bothered by the level of contrivance in the events that push the plot forward. There’s definitely some lazy writing from time to time that I found to be distracting. It’s hard to be too critical of this, though, given how fantastical the premise is. I mean, it’s a movie about a woman who is magically transported into the body of a child, but… I’d say that it’s a manner of when and how the story breaks apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;em&gt;Little&lt;/em&gt; is an outlandish comedy that has enough going on to stand out from other movies like it. The acting and writing delighted me and it’s an easy film to recommend, definitely give this one a watch.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/04/2019-04-09-breakthrough.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Transcript&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Breakthrough is the latest Christian film based on an incredible true story. It’s directed by Roxann Dawson, who has directed a ton of television episodes and this is her directorial debut for a feature film. 14 year old, John Smith played by Marcial Ruiz, falls through ice and by the time the responders are able to retrieve him, he is in a fatal condition. Chrissy Metz who you may know from This is Us, plays the overprotective faith-filled mother who is told by doctors that it is not likely John will survive. We get to see the struggles John’s Mom, Dad, and pastor face waiting in a hospital and praying that God will save John’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mother and son characters feel real and really reminded me a lot of my mom and I when I was a teen. John is a normal adolescent who is going through that phase where he doesn’t want to tell his parents anything. He wears his headphones on the way to school and is embarrassed when his mom tries talking to his friends. You understand his character and also feel sympathy for the mom who just wants to connect with her son prior to the accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chrissy Metz is the best part of the entire film and I think there’s a lot of people who would have failed to capture the emotion and heartbreak that she does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film is only 90 minutes but it feels a bit long as there’s a subplot about the firefighter who rescued John not believing in God that could have been cut or they should have spent more time making us care about it. There’s a scene where the pastor of the church is having a meal with his family that could’ve been cut. Anything that deviated away from John and his mom was not nearly as interesting but luckily that was not too often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakthrough is an emotionally moving film that faith-based families and individuals are really going to enjoy. I myself fall into that target audience and so I will admit that my personal experiences with going to church, even working at a church as a media worker, and learning about prayer- all may have affected my positive enjoyment of this film. If you’re someone who does not share these beliefs or if you have a negative view on faith you’ll probably find a lot of dialogue and actions that the characters take to be super cheesy and way over-the-top. However, go check out this movie if you want to see a heartbreaking inspirational true story where the power of prayer saves a boy from what the doctors say is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This film releases April 17th, a few days before Easter. This would be a good one to go watch after church or after an easter program with church friends or family.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/04/2019-04-05-pet-sematary.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Transcript&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pet Semetary is a remake of the 1989 film and is based off the novel by Stephen King, both also titled Pet Semetary with an S. Dr. Louis Creed played by Jason Clarke and his wife, Rachel played by Amy Seimetz, move into a new home with their two young children. When Louis finds the family cat dead, John Lithgow who plays the Creeds neighbor, shows Louis a way to bring this beloved pet back to life. However, this gato resurrects extremely pissed off and is clearly not the same adorable creature it was before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the movie starts off fairly bland, I will admit that the 2nd act after the cat is resurrected was interesting as the film will make you wonder what will happen next and what or who is behind these mysterious semetary powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, any movie that gets you to ask questions is going to fall flat if those questions aren’t answered or if you’re given an answer that’s not very compelling…and that’s exactly what happened with this film. I was invested for a short amount of time but as the story drags on, I quickly came to the realization that the film was not interested in telling a clever narrative that is truly disturbing but it instead falls into the same tropes that are in so many other horror films. There’s lots of walking around, lots of shots of the camera panning and then a loud noise going off, and there’s a mirror scare in this movie. All things that we’ve seen in other scary movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an attempt to flesh out the characters. Louis’s wife, Rachel, has a backstory involving her sister. However, I unfortunately didn’t think it was very strong. The backstory felt very contrived and the performances could’ve been more compelling considering the hardships Louis and Rachel were going through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tension is often diffused by subtle comedy which wasn’t necessarily good or bad. It didn’t hurt the story but it didn’t really help either. You can decide if comedy amidst a serious horror film is something you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite aspects of Pet Semetary is that it is only 1 hour and 40 minutes and so if you end up trapped watching this movie, you get to get out really quickly and I was very thankful for that.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/03/2019-03-31-shazam.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Transcript&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shazam is directed by David F. Sandberg and tells the story of young Billy Batson, played by Asher Angel, who is an orphan that goes to live with a foster family that is raising 5 other children. One weird evening, Billy is on a subway and transported to a magical world where a really old wizard gives Billy the power to transform into an adult superhero whose portrayed by Zachary Levi simply by shouting SHAZAM! One of Billy’s foster siblings, Freddy, helps Billy figure out his super powers and eventually how to stop the villain of our movie, Dr. Thadeous Sivana, portrayed by Mark Strong, from destroying the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shazam was really funny and very different than a lot of superhero films as of lately. Where Captain Marvel is very serious and tries to be realistic, Shazam is silly, light-hearted, and comedic. It is well-aware of what it is and doesn’t try to be this heavy serious film, which allowed me to be more graceful with some of the flaws that I did have with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that made me roll my eyes is the villain, Dr. Sivana’s motive for doing all these destructive things. It is silly and hard to believe. At the same time, I was happy it wasn’t this complex convoluted motive. It’s a simple reason but one that made me think, “Dude, get over it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also because it is light-hearted and funny, there was never a tense moment. I didn’t fear for our characters lives because I knew the type of film this was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of that being said, Zachary Levi as adult Shazam made this movie. He was wildly entertaining and energetic. He really felt like a kid who is freaked out over what is happening to him and the dialogue between him and his foster sibling Freddy, whose played by Jack Dylan Grazer, made the best and most interesting parts of this movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a subplot about Billy’s mom that I enjoyed and will pull on your heartstrings and it gave Billy’s character more depth.  While the film lacked emotions of tension and suspense, it did have heart and had a decent amounts of laughs.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/03/2019-03-29-dumbo.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Transcript&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dumbo is directed by Tim Burton and stars Colin Farrell who plays a man named Holt who is put in charge of taking care of the newborn elephant Dumbo, who is made fun of because of his oversized ears. Danny Devito, who plays the owner of the struggling circus, begins to attract masses after Holt’s kids figure out a way to make Dumbo fly. One of these attendees is played by Michael Keaton who is the antagonist, V.A. Vandevere and wants to utilize Dumbo for his gigantic more successful circus called Dreamland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kids are really going to enjoy Dumbo, who is adorable and you want to see him win in the end. The film can pull on your heart strings a bit as it works hard to get you to feel for this baby elephant- from hearing the masses laughing at him, to close-ups of those scared blue eyes, and to knowing that he misses his mom- the innocent Dumbo was a loveable CGI character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie is beautiful to look at. I really admire Tim Burton’s bright saturated colors that bring this story to life. Even at night-time scenes, the sky isn’t pitch black but has an attractive bright blue glow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However- unless you’re a die hard Dumbo fan, I don’t think this movie is compelling enough to go watch alone or with other adults. While the film is a family-friendly movie, the problem older audiences may have is that is very safe with no surprises. I felt like a director like Tim Burton would’ve ventured out and taken some risk, but it does seem Disney wanted to keep this beloved classic in a safe zone. It feels very formulaic and while it does have likeable characters and emotional moments, the lack of surprise made it a little hard to sit through the almost 2 hour length. When you can easily guess how scenes will play out and how the movie will end, it’s boring. Many scenes feel similar to one another- as we see Dumbo attempt to fly 5-6 different times and the movie takes place in only a few different locations that mostly all feel the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Keaton’s villainous V.A. Vandevere felt very fake and over the top. I didn’t buy his character as a realistic threat.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/03/2019-03-24-the-highwaymen.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Transcript&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Highawaymen tells the true story of two Texas Rangers, portrayed by Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson, as they attempt to take down criminals Bonnie and Clyde.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Highawaymen suffers from terrible slow pacing and drags on forever. There’s lots of uninteresting scenes- from simple conversations, to getting guns, to practicing gun shooting- it was a chore to put in effort to stay tuned into the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A film about criminals on the run and our characters tracking them down should have been tension-filled but there’s hardly any scenes where I felt a real imminent danger. There’s a couple of chase scenes and some gun shooting scenes but because I didn’t care for any of the characters, I could care less what resulted from all these scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film lacks an emotional connection to the characters as I rarely cared what would happen to them. There is an attempt to connect us emotionally to Kevin Cosner’s character’s wife by showing his worrisome wife show concern as he chooses to venture off on his dangerous criminal chase and I did enjoy that scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with everything that’s available on Netflix, I can’t recommend that you spend over 2 hours of your life on this very boring movie.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/03/2019-03-20-us.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Transcript&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Us is directed by Jordan Peele and stars Lupita Nyong’o and Winston Duke, who play a mother and father who take their kids on vacation. This getaway turns into a nightmare when they bump into strangers who look just like them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Us is a creepishly fun film with a creative premise that goes in a direction you won’t expect. I loved that I did not know what was going to happen and the ending, which I will not spoil, was a bit unsettling and makes you want to check out the film a second time. There’s a lot of information I think someone would learn looking at the movie through the lens of what we learn at the ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does Us stack up against Get Out? I definitely liked Get Out more but the two movies are very different. Us won’t live up to the Oscar-worthy praise that Get Out received but it is an above average horror film that is mostly entertaining to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through music and an interesting story that feels very original, Jordan Peele masterfully creates a tension filled atmosphere. There’s moments where you’re eyes are transfixed on what you’re watching because you have no clue what is going to unfold. It is a bit creepy to imagine people that look just like you appear and as you begin to find out why they are there and what they want, it is a bit unnerving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a little bit of comedy that also works in this film because of Winston’s Duke character. His ignorance of these look-alike characters had some laugh-out-loud moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My big complaint about Us is there’s about 10-20 minutes of typical running around horror stuff that could’ve been cut out. There’s a sequence for each of the four family members that felt like I had seen it before. It felt like padding and I wanted to the movie to get to the point. If you’re a fan of these horror are-they-going-to-get-them eerie scenes, this may not bother you– but I felt like it dragged for a bit longer than it needed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I did like the surprise ending but I am curious how it would’ve played out had we learned about it just a little bit earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/03/2019-03-13-the-beach-bum.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;At this stage in my life I just simply wasn’t prepared for &lt;em&gt;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&lt;/em&gt; through Prozac tinted lenses, and so &lt;em&gt;The Beach Bum&lt;/em&gt; took me by surprise. That is just as compelling as it sounds as writer/director Harmony Korine dives into some uncomfortable space, without judgment, along a path driven entirely by emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSALRP1mZNQ&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beach Bum&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a talented writer, Moondog, who married into extreme wealth who disposes of everything in his life of value with complete carelessness via continuous drunken benders. I cannot help but feel that taking the complete reckless lack of consideration for the human condition or real needs that comes with extreme luxury is deeply unpleasant to experience even when dressed it in the trappings of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deeply unpleasant… but not wholly without merit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to say what message you’re supposed to walk away from &lt;em&gt;The Beach Bum&lt;/em&gt; with. Harmony Korine has composed a work that works on a couple of layers. The most immediate and visible layer is the nihilistic joy that Moondog enjoys as he lives a life without want, need, or direction even as he burns down the world around him. Astute viewers will take note of the toll which Moondog’s life extracts from all of those around him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core of this work is the performance delivered by Matthew McConaughey as Moondog, which is every bit as engrossing as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCRZZC-DH7M&quot;&gt;the blaze that Moondog sets to his world&lt;/a&gt;. There are so many other talented performances here, but it is McConaughey who drives this story in a way that few actors could. It is his performance that makes such a painful journey into an enjoyable experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say that &lt;em&gt;The Beach Bum&lt;/em&gt; is a good film in that it is good because it is difficult to get out of your head after you’ve watched it. It is nihilism at its most beautiful. It is the nihilism you experience in a moment of crisis when the whole world is on your shoulders with such profound force that the realization that none of it matters allows you to feel as though you could fly. Sometimes you need that, but even that brief respite comes at the expense of those around you and those who support you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for all of those reasons, it is also tragically disagreeable. I can’t tell you if you should or shouldn’t see &lt;em&gt;The Beach Bum&lt;/em&gt;, only that watching it takes a toll on you. It has moments that are entertaining. Moments that are horrific. It is hedonistic and nihilistic. If that’s your thing you may love it, and if it isn’t… this is the most palatable distillation of those ideals.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/03/2019-03-13-the-beach-bum-jason.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Transcript&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Beach Bum stars Matthew McConaughey as Moondog, a dude who likes to drink, get high, sleep with multiple women that aren’t his wife, and makes lots of outrageous choices that drastically affect his life and those around him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t mind silly entertainment if it’s funny, but The Beach Bum’s comedy often misses and it all involves repeatedly using physical humor, penis jokes, weed, and outlandish behavior to grab the audience’s attention. Even if you enjoy this type of humor, I still don’t think there’s much to love. There are a few laugh out loud moments, but the laughs were not frequent enough to warrant a full price movie ticket. The movie feels like it’s scenes are repeating with the same humor being used over and over. It gets old after awhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The negative messages in the film could be disturbing to some viewers as Director Korine said in an interview that he wants stressed audience members to be carefree like our protagonist who has no character arc and does not change throughout the film. The message should’ve been advocating against our main character, who uses pot and alcohol to stay happy despite hurting those around him through his crazy actions. Positive mindsets are great, but having an inconsequential attitude is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie feels longer than it’s short 96 minute running time, as I often kept hoping that it would end and it seemed to take forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting actors Isla Fisher, Snoop Dog, Zac Efron, and Stefani Owen who play family member and friends, do very little to stand out as they only exist to act as pawns who suffer consequences because of Moondog’s mistakes or enable him to be as crazy as he is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harmony Korine has developed an unfunny stoner movie that should at best be something played in the background but is not worth heading out to the theatre for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captain Marvel is directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck and is the 21st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe- but is actually a prequel that takes place before the first Iron Man film. It’s 1995 and there’s two galactic groups at war with each other: the Kree and the Skrulls. Our story centers around Carol Danvers, portrayed by Brie Larson, who is a part the group known as the Kree and throughout the film she learns things about her past that she was unaware of and this dramatically affects who she becomes. Ben Mendelsohn is Talos, the leader of the Skrulls and our main villain. Samuel L. Jackson, de-aged digitally by 25 years, reprises the role of Nick Fury who still has an eye and at this point has not started the Avengers initiative. Fury’s interaction with Carol Danvers has a huge affect not only on this origin story of Captain Marvel, but also the MCU as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest complaint about Captain Marvel is that the beginning setup is incredibly slow. Die hard comic book movie fans may not mind as much as I did but I found these lengthy dialogue-focused scenes to be unengaging.
The tone of the film feels similar to many other comic book movies and while the setup and structure is different, it just felt like a generic superhero movie. It’s fun. There’s action. but- if you do not like super hero movies I can’t see this changing your mind and if you do love super hero movies this will probably be enjoyable as it felt it to be similar to others I had seen before. If you’re somewhere in the middle like me, this movie will probably be mixed for you is well.
Luckily, once the setup is complete, the fight scenes and acting by Brie Larson was good. I felt several decent moments of tension fused with humor and I was interested with how the story would resolve. Danvers has lots of good chemistry with a few different characters. I liked her relationship with Nick Fury but also her friend Monica whose played by Lashana Lynch. She was a pleasant addition as I liked the friendship between the two characters.
The story does begin with Carol Danvers having her powers and I think I would’ve been interested in seeing more of her before she got her powers. Seeing more of a human side to her, could have maybe allowed me to connect better with her character.
Despite this being a prequel, there are easter eggs and subtle references to other MCU movies, that it certainly helps if you’ve seen some of the other Marvel films. In fact, my favorite aspect of Captain Marvel is how it connects to Avengers: Endgame. I won’t spoil how that is but make sure you stay around for two end credit scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/02/2019-02-28-things-we-love-about-velvet-buzzsaw.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is so easy to get lost in talking about whether a movie as a whole is good or bad or whether it is worth watching. I think that we can lose so much valuable nuance by reducing our discussion of films to this context, and so today I want to do something a little different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XdAR-lK43YU&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix recently released &lt;em&gt;Velvet Buzzsaw&lt;/em&gt;, a quirky supernatural slasher flick from director Dan Gilroy about a group of people who represent those who profit from the exploitation of art by literally being murdered by art that surrounds them. It’s not a perfect film, but I enjoyed it immensely and there were some elements of it that I absolutely loved. Given the ubiquity of Netflix, this is an opportunity to change the nature of criticism. I think the root of criticism should be about a discussion of films as art, diving into their merits far beyond whether or not you should watch them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in the spirit of pure appreciation, I would rather talk simply about why this movie resonated with me so strongly without splitting hairs over the quality of its execution, without worrying about spoilers, and without worrying about whether or not I’m wasting your time and money by recommending a film you may not like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, here are 5 things that I simply loved about &lt;em&gt;Velvet Buzzsaw&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Warning: Spoilers ahead, so stop reading now and go watch the movie before reading on if you want that experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-neurotic-performances&quot;&gt;5. Neurotic Performances&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am always thrilled when actors can play with a role. Getting to see wonky performances from talented individuals as they explore their space without boundaries is unique. &lt;em&gt;Velvet Buzzsaw&lt;/em&gt; has three performances that stand out specifically: Jake Gyllenhaal, John Malkovitch, and Toni Collette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These performers approach their roles without shame with an almost Nicholas Cage lack of shame turning in pure entertainment gold. We’ve seen this side of John Malkovitch before and that is part of the reason why he is one of my favorite actors. I already also love both Toni Collette and Jake Gyllenhaal, with Toni Collette turning in one of my favorite performances for all of last year in &lt;em&gt;Hereditary&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Velvet Buzzsaw&lt;/em&gt; brought out something deeply memorable from these phenomenal performers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-tattoos-are-art&quot;&gt;4. Tattoos Are Art&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have several cultural wars in the US as marginalized groups struggle for recognition and representation. Our society struggles with long debates over what is and is not art, leaving several industries fighting for validity. Video games, graphic novels, and even tattoos have to kick and scream to get recognized for what they really and truly are: Art. Plain and simple, all of these are creative endeavors that express important thoughts and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How explicitly does &lt;em&gt;Velvet Buzzsaw&lt;/em&gt; acknowledge that tattoos are art? As mentioned before, the core plot of the film is about characters being murdered by the art around them. The final surviving character, Rhodora Haze (Played by Renee Russo), removes all of the art in her entire house after learning that the string of victims have all been murdered or otherwise killed by the art they are surrounded by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the last moment, when she is sitting alone after having removed every painting or sculpture from around her, we see that there is one piece of art that she forgot about. A tattoo on the back of her neck that was prominently featured as a part of her character. In those final moments, the tattoo comes to life, violently killing Rhodora. This act unifies tattoos with all of the other art in the film, clearly making a statement, and that statement is that these acts of expression are meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-visual-style&quot;&gt;3. Visual Style&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director Dan Gilroy has filled the space of each frame with beautiful and powerful works of art. Compelling visual rustic colors, haunting symbols, and even stark modern sculpture. In a film about art, the art itself is used as a palette with entire styles of art used to decorate a frame the way others would use mere colors. The works of art that fill out the environment of &lt;em&gt;Velvet Buzzsaw&lt;/em&gt; drew me in as much as the story itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-the-art-is-the-victim&quot;&gt;2. The Art is the Victim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In so many similar movies that cut at the art world, we see the art itself as part of the problem. It gets definitively included with all of the things that are wrong with the world in which it is surrounded. However, in &lt;em&gt;Velvet Buzzsaw&lt;/em&gt; the art itself is the victim. The art is beautiful, genuine, and engrossing while it is surrounded by people who do a disservice to the very concept of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is profoundly important because it can be difficult to separate art itself from the disingenuous world and practices in which it is immersed. As an appreciator of the importance of communication, I value this aspect of &lt;em&gt;Velvet Buzzsaw&lt;/em&gt; deeply. It means so much to see that the film clearly knows that the crimes of the main characters are horrible specifically because art is so essential to the human condition for sharing our humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-art-is-dangerous&quot;&gt;1. Art is Dangerous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lasting message from the film is embodied clearly in the statement “all art is dangerous.” This statement is profound if not particularly new. It resonates deeply inside of us. Art inspires love, war, and revolution. It always speaks to something inside of us. Making this message the core of a cheesy slasher elevates it to something that reverberates inside of you if you are open to that powerful statement. Any film that has me walking away remembering how true this is has done something special for me.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/02/2019-02-28-greta.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Transcript&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greta is a horror thriller directed by Neil Jordan and centers around a young girl named Francis, portrayed by Chloë Grace Moretz who finds a bag on a subway. Looking at the driver’s license inside, Frances decides to return this item to Isabelle Huppert’s much older character, Greta. The two develop an unlikely bond and we are taken on a thrill ride, as you soon discover that Greta is not all who she appears to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greta easily will hold your interest from the beginning until the very end. I was intrigued with learning about Greta’s character and as the story unfolds, new mysteries develop and I wanted to know what was going to happen and how it would all end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acting by our leads is impressive, as there’s several scenes that rely heavily on dialogue and their performances held my attention. Isabelle Huppert does a tremendous job playing someone who initially seems innocent and slowly transforms into someone you won’t expect. All of the fear Moret’s character feels is believable and it felt like these circumstances that she’s in were realistic. Also, Mike-uh Monroe was a pleasant supporting actress who plays Frances’s best friend Erica and she tries to help Francis throughout the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie does show us how difficult it can be to get out of the situation that Frances finds herself in, as the police and those that she works with offer no help. This causes us to feel sympathy for Frances and hopefully will cause actual police to think about how someone in this situation can get real help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The screenplay has some unusual storytelling choices that were slightly aggravating. For example, there’s a sequence where the film tricks the audience into thinking that a character is having a dream and it was very unnecessary. There’s questions I had about how long a character had been at a certain place and when I think the film is going to answer this question, it decides not to. Also, the ending had me roll my eyes as it seems to try to setup a sequel that does not need to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these small conundrums that mostly all take place at the very end, I think Greta is a decent suspenseful thrill ride.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/02/2019-02-25-what-men-want.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;If you ever wondered what a super raunchy version of the politically-correct retelling of a forgotten cheap Mel Gibson comedy would look like… It’s here. &lt;em&gt;What Men Want&lt;/em&gt; is a gender-flipped revision of the rightfully forgotten &lt;em&gt;What Women Want&lt;/em&gt; from the early 2000s, but with the adult-humor cranked up to a solid 8. It works better than it should, but maybe not quite as well as it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/HeoLiTirRp4&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the majority of audiences, the most important thing here is just about how funny it is. Personally, I laughed. I laughed pretty hard at times. There’s a solid cast here with great charisma and an interesting script for a foundation. The core of the humor is rooted in mature themes, so think dicks, dicks, dicks, and if you can’t handle that, then you may want to move on. But if you’re fine with the worst of &lt;em&gt;Van Wilder&lt;/em&gt; you won’t find anything that you haven’t seen before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where things get interesting is just how sensitive &lt;em&gt;What Men Want&lt;/em&gt; is when approaching its core themes. &lt;em&gt;What Women Want&lt;/em&gt; was a problematic film that couldn’t have existed today and both the writers and directors had a lot of social issues to get right. In a lot of ways, the audience for this film is more sensitive to issues of masculinity, identity, gas lighting, and social equality. That is a nightmare tightrope to walk across and I think &lt;em&gt;What Men Want&lt;/em&gt; does so admirably. I think that the writers succeed in this by approaching men and women as both wanting the same things, despite the ways in which they are different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing, though… most of the issues with the original didn’t stand out so prominently when it came out. This is partly why this movie is such an interesting barometer for how society has changed in the near 20 years since &lt;em&gt;What Women Want&lt;/em&gt; came out. In that sense, it becomes pretty challenging to say how the views in this film will hold up over the next 10 or 20 years. This is compounded by the raunchiness of the humor. You just never know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels weird giving a number to comedies because whether or not it makes you laugh is so much of what defines it. Is it funny? That depends on the person. But in the case of &lt;em&gt;What Men Want&lt;/em&gt;, there’s something extra here. That sense of looking into how our perspectives have changed about gendered social interaction, and in that sense, it digs into some things that are worth thinking about. I love that there is that layer of cultural meaning to what is otherwise a pretty pithy one note raunch comedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is &lt;em&gt;What Men Want&lt;/em&gt; worth watching? I’d say that it most definitely is, though if you have delicate sensibilities I’d still recommend giving it a pass. It’s better than it had any right to be, and I enjoyed the show despite its shortcomings. I’m giving this a 70/100, give or take 10 depending on your sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/02/2019-02-12-happy-death-day-2u.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Transcript&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Death Day 2U was a fun, exuberantly upbeat, movie that tells the story of a girl named Tree, played by Jessica Rothe, who dies a bunch of times and, just like in the first film, is put back to living that same day over and over again. However, this time she learns that those closest to her are involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you liked the first Happy Death Day, you should really like this movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Death 2U is not a horror film as some may think, but is more of an adventurous comedy and it completely works. The pacing in this movie is so tight and perfect, as the story moves along at a rapid pace and it can be appreciated that several complex ideas were communicated tremendously well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story satisfyingly answers the one question I wanted answered in the first movie and that is: why is Tree in a time loop? which I will not spoil, but I loved the explanation. It wasn’t cheesy and it felt as realistic as you could make it be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessica Rothe is a freak. Her performance is full of high-energy from beginning to end and she does everything right. She can scream, she can cry, and she can look beautiful with blood and cuts on her face. I had a fun time seeing her do anything on screen! She was anything but one-note and I believe she makes this series as good as it is. Her character, Tree, learns a life lesson about letting go of the past and it was pleasant to see how her character undergoes a genuine change.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2019/01/2019-01-25-serenity.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Despite being drowned in narrative problems that make &lt;em&gt;Serenity&lt;/em&gt; unpleasantly frustrating to watch, the totally bonkers premise wrapped in an astoundingly beautiful location is almost worth the experience. I hate that I have to start with the negatives for this review because the positive things I have to say are outstandingly glowing that if I put them first it will fail to emphasize how negative the overall experience is despite them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SbrOMrjhyvI&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Serenity&lt;/em&gt;’s narrative suffers from 2 core flaws: it believes that the premise is WAY smarter than it is, and it believes that its audience is completely brain dead. I can understand how these sound similar, but these sins are in fact represent two clear forms of dissonance to the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the absolutely bonkers story that &lt;em&gt;Serenity&lt;/em&gt; is wrapped around plays directly to some of my personal tastes, so it should be a near perfect movie for me. Where the director stumbles is with how the plot unravels with a series of reveals that are doled out slowly over the runtime of the film. Early on the reveals are so clearly informative of what is happening that the pacing leaves the audience with a clear understanding of what is happening long before the film completes the process of exposing its inner workings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That dissonant feeling of already knowing what’s happening, but having the film play as though you shouldn’t know what is happening leaves a salty taste of pretentiousness behind. I believe this is what will bother most viewers. Even if the ideas are vague enough that you are able to remain in the dark for the majority of the length of the film, the extent to which &lt;em&gt;Serenity&lt;/em&gt;’s plot is drawn out will leave you confused and bored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you finally reach the end of the movie, though, it holds nothing back. Everything is spelled out in exposition. You’re told in no uncertain words what happened, who everyone is, what will happen next, and why everything is the way it is. It’s a completely separate fault of over explaining that dashes whatever remaining harmony remains against the rocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is deeply tragic, because, as I said before, the premise is so bonkers that I was almost personally in love. In addition to the off-the-wall story, I also have to call out some of the outstanding use of cinematic language that director Steven Knight uses to communicate information before he starts beating you over the head with visual symbolism. This is visible in the use of surreal glints of light to draw your attention to details that are important later on when you look in the same place or information that is just on your peripheral but just off enough that you can read the details that flesh out the world in fascinating ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot express enough that I eat this kind of thing up whenever I can. I adore subtle communication, metaphor, and wildly surprising ideas. Up until the execution, it was like this film was written &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; me. Unfortunately, execution is the perfect word for describing what the writer and director managed to do to undermine what would otherwise be an outstanding gem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gorgeous scenery also demands a quick mention. Visually, I want to live inside this film. &lt;em&gt;Serenity&lt;/em&gt; was shot on some of the most inviting beaches I have ever seen and it makes you want to be there. It makes you want to just dive into the water and swim in the sun. The entire cast sells the place, making it just feel so inviting despite all the turmoil around them. It adds to the best parts of the surrealism of the overall feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything inside me wants to recommend &lt;em&gt;Serenity&lt;/em&gt;, but I just can’t. If you are dearly in love with high concept ideas and can overlook damning implementation, then give it a try. Anyone else should just find the most beautiful Jacques Cousteau documentary they can to watch instead.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/12/2018-12-22-aquaman.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;It’s fine. Just… fine. You’ll probably enjoy it and forget about it. It’s the second best film in the DC extended universe, and that’s something, right? It’s well paced, decently choreographed, has witty dialog, and even has a few positive observations on responsibility. So why do I absolutely hate &lt;em&gt;Aquaman&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WDkg3h8PCVU&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate it because it feels dated. Because the messaging of a movie is as important as the quality of craftsmanship. &lt;em&gt;Aquaman&lt;/em&gt; is literally over 2 hours of two dudes smashing their spears together to see whose is hardest and then going on a quest for a harder spear, and whoever wins gets the girl. Marvel got past their shallow might-makes-right style storytelling almost 2 years ago and have been putting out the best movies they have ever made since then. DC has access to templates that work… decades of comics and even films that transcend the genre. Even within the DC extended universe, Wonder Woman managed to explore personal sacrifice, identity, humanity, and even the nature of conflict in stunning new ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being more entertaining than &lt;em&gt;Batman v Superman&lt;/em&gt; isn’t enough. All that &lt;em&gt;Aquaman&lt;/em&gt; really manages to do is to competently construct a movie around its garbage story as a monument to mediocrity. I’d rather rewatch &lt;em&gt;Venom&lt;/em&gt; in all of its flawed awful glory than &lt;em&gt;Aquaman&lt;/em&gt;.  The worst way to tell a bad story is to put it together well enough that it’s boring. If you want a case study in this, watch &lt;em&gt;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&lt;/em&gt;’s theatrical release back to back with the leaked workprint version and you will see exactly what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if &lt;em&gt;The Room&lt;/em&gt; had been made by an experienced director with actors turning out engaging and human performances while an aggressive and mindful editor trimmed the story into a film with a well-paced sense of direction and you’d be left with &lt;em&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey&lt;/em&gt;. A bad film by any standards, but just normal bad and good enough for the niche audience it appeals to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aquaman&lt;/em&gt;’s niche audience may be larger, but it’s still just that. A hand-me-down sweater packaged in a pretty box with shiny wrapping and a pretty bow on top for Christmas. Maybe this would have been fine in the 90s, and even if you watch it you may even enjoy it while you sit through it, but you deserve better and better is out right now. Watch something else.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/12/2018-12-21-welcome-to-marwen.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;It is fascinating to take an extreme lens to a subject and give it enough life to change the way you perceive it in the way that &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Marwen&lt;/em&gt; does. Taking trauma and making it viscerally palpable is like that. Director Robert Zemeckis challenges viewers to see the world in a new way with a work that uses fantastical framing to highlight the impact of intense suffering, and it mostly works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/W6dy7xQ8NeE&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context, &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Marwen&lt;/em&gt; attempts to paint a picture of how assault survivor Mark Hogancamp (Steve Carell) experiences the world by building a model town as a coping mechanism. He projects his pains and difficulties into this miniaturized world in an attempt to feel some level of control over his universe. It’s a challenging subject that Robert Zemeckis tries to illustrate by zooming all the way into the model village and animating the action when Hogancamp retreats into that world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, it’s entertaining and whimsical to see scantily clad barbies fighting off Nazi action figures. The animation is charming as they go from animated inhabitants of the world to dolls toppled over into stiff and unmoving reminders that we’re watching toys. But if you pay attention, you start to see that they aren’t toys. They’re projections that step in during the most painful scenes of the story. Similar to how bleeping out language fails to really censor the language because the tone comes through while the context conveys the intention of the word that is being censored, these scenes take on the pain of the moments they replace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the silly moments of dolls jumping to life and fighting off Nazi action figures start to make you feel sick because you realize that what you’re seeing is happening in place of one of the most sickening moments in the entire story it becomes gut-wrenching.  It’s a gradual transition and it is fantastic when it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of elements that hold it back. The main stumbling block is that the transitions aren’t consistent. They’re overused and often used purely for storytelling and communicating backstory. Since it’s essential that the audience understand, almost on a Pavlovian level, that these moments are surrogates for the pain that Hogancamp is avoiding it is detrimental to have them used for anything else. Equally distracting, though, is the attempt to paint a picture of Hogancamp that captures his flaws too clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problematically, Hogancamp’s coping mechanism also acted as an outlet for unhealthy relationships and obsessions. While this may paint an accurate picture of the real person and give the film texture, it also makes it difficult to sympathize with him at times. There are moments where he comes off as genuinely creepy when he confuses fantasy with reality. This may even be a style choice, where Zemeckis wanted to challenge the audience with a blunter picture of mental illness. However, I feel it may work against the need of the film to make the primary focus of the film relatable and understandable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Zemeckis deserves a lot of credit for trying to do something beautiful and unique with &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Marwen&lt;/em&gt;.  Though the film stumbles, in many ways it does convey trauma in a new way that may help people who are struggling. For that, I am glad it exists.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/12/2018-12-21-second-act.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Can we all agree that it’s weird when Lifetime movie material makes it to the big screen because it has one really major performer in it? &lt;em&gt;Second Act&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostly_Harmless&quot;&gt;mostly harmless&lt;/a&gt; fantasy of trying to break through the glass ceilings that hold so many people down that is carried on the back of Jennifer Lopez. It’s cheesy and sappy while also being pretty entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people who check out &lt;em&gt;Second Act&lt;/em&gt; will be here for Jennifer Lopez, and if you are then you will not be disappointed. While I don’t think it’s right to call this her A game, Jennifer is thoroughly entertaining throughout. She’s not alone, either. There’s an awesome cast here bringing an ensemble of characters that are likable and entertaining. Some of the absolute standouts for me were Charlyne Yi, Alan Aisenberg, and Leah Remini, but the whole cast was on point. It feels really good when you have a whole team that is working together and there are no real weak links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the writing is fun. There’s nothing truly amazing here and it may feel perfunctory to some, but I don’t think that’s particularly fair. There isn’t anything life-changing here, but not every movie needs to be. Some days you just need something sweet and light to help you feel just a bit better about the world, and for the most part, &lt;em&gt;Second Act&lt;/em&gt; fills those shoes. Mostly. Some weird messaging about the desire to have kids weaves its way through the narrative that will not sit well with everyone who watches it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I’m not going to pull my punches. The way the movie handles the conflict between a couple that has different life goals is downright bad. I was extremely unhappy with how it resolves the relationship between a woman who doesn’t want kids and a man who cannot be in a relationship with a woman who won’t raise children with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, on top of this problematic messaging, it is fair to say that &lt;em&gt;Second Act&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t really aspire to do anything amazing. While you’re likely to enjoy it in the here and now, &lt;em&gt;Second Act&lt;/em&gt; will quietly fade into the background of your life till one day you stumble over it on Netflix or whatever and choose to watch something similar but better instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you just need something light to keep you warm for a night, &lt;em&gt;Second Act&lt;/em&gt; will probably fill that role if you’re not particularly sensitive about unhealthy relationship pressures. It’s fun, there are a few laughs, a few feels, and it’s a bit uplifting despite being pretty forgettable.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/12/2018-12-18-mary-poppins-returns.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Seemingly the product of a committee of people who have not watched the original within the past 20 years, &lt;em&gt;Mary Poppins Returns&lt;/em&gt; is an ADD-riddled caricature of its predecessor. While it would be easy to list a variety of faults, such as poor performances, illogical plot points, crowded narrative, 2-dimensional villains, having villains at all, forgettable songs, etc., I don’t think it would be fair. Really, all of these elements are only symptoms of 2 core failings of &lt;em&gt;Mary Poppins Returns&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bb32hHcf2WY&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the film is a cartoonish exaggeration of the essence of &lt;em&gt;Mary Poppins&lt;/em&gt;. Everything from the visual style to the very narrative structure strives to capture the feeling of the classic work while completely overlooking the substance. Emily Blunt’s portrayal of Mary Poppins takes the performance of Julie Andrews and discards any element of reservation, subtlety, and thoughtfulness as she plows through the film. The structure is so busy trying to look and feel like &lt;em&gt;Marry Poppins&lt;/em&gt; that it fails to give the audience a moment to stop and appreciate it. &lt;em&gt;Mary Poppins Returns&lt;/em&gt; never stops moving long enough to be sincere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where this really hurts is in the lack of melancholy and emotional texture that defined &lt;em&gt;Mary Poppins&lt;/em&gt;. What I remember best about Mary Poppins is how deeply sad she made me feel in ways that I didn’t understand, causing me to stop and consider my own emotions. Alan Moore once said that the challenge of revisiting works like this is that you can’t just make something that’s as good as or the same, but that you have to make it as good as people &lt;em&gt;remember&lt;/em&gt; it. While the frantic exaggeration seems to miss what was really special, it is because the film is trying to capture how people remember feeling. I just wish that the creators had remembered feeling something more meaningful than, “Isn’t it wonderful, she’s flying!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5JU0ILjStgA&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This flows very naturally into the next major failing: a failure to understand the nature of the type of conflict that made the original work. &lt;em&gt;Mary Poppins Returns&lt;/em&gt; attempts to replace the deep personal drama of the challenges of remaining childlike in the face of the demands of an adult world with shallow and even nonsensical villains. All of the practical challenges faced in the original &lt;em&gt;Mary Poppins&lt;/em&gt; are window dressing, the real problem is the relationship between Mr. Banks with himself and his children. When you solve their problems with magic, it doesn’t hurt the story because they’re not the real problems. The real problems Mr. Banks has to face are internal, and must be faced alone… they have weight and the audience feels them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Mary Poppins Returns&lt;/em&gt;, all of the internal problems are symptoms caused by the external problems. So, when Mary Poppins solves all of their problems with magic, because those conflicts are all it has, it removes any weight there is to the progress of the characters. There’s no value to their accomplishments because they’re never earned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate being this negative. There’s plenty to enjoy in &lt;em&gt;Mary Poppins Returns&lt;/em&gt;. It’s relatively inoffensive at its best moments and is generally pretty mediocre as family films go. Children and their parents will undoubtedly be entertained. It’s just unfortunate that it likely won’t leave the kind of deeply lasting complex mark on those children as the original did in its time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, despite being relatively entertaining, &lt;em&gt;Mary Poppins Returns&lt;/em&gt; also suffers from structural problems that compound the core areas where it fails systemically. The overall product is a film that may be enjoyed, but only in spite of the plethora of failings. Even if it looks good to you, check out almost any other family film right now. There’s a chance  you’ll enjoy it, but you still deserve better.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/12/2018-12-16-spider-man-into-the-spider-verse.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;If someone had told me a week ago that &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt; would be among the very best Spider-Man films, I honestly wouldn’t have believed it. So I understand if you’re skeptical. I’m right there with you. &lt;em&gt;Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt; fires on almost all cylinders as it delivers a knockout story with astounding visual style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tg52up16eq0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While what really pops out is the visual style, I want to start by talking about the story. It’s the story that made me laugh. it’s the story that moved me enough to shed a few tears. So, there are those of you looking at that trailer and thinking to yourselves, “That’s not my Spider-Man… who is that?” If you’re in that boat, the young man that &lt;em&gt;Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt; focuses on is Miles Morales who exists in an alternate continuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, if you aren’t already familiar with Miles Morales, getting you filled in on exactly who he is and how he fits into this alternate continuity would spoil &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; film. Suffice it to say, you’ll get caught up. In addition to Miles Morales, &lt;em&gt;Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt; uses interdimensional travel to bring together a wide variety of gimmicky Spider-Men that work together in an entertaining ensemble. While this will likely serve as world-building for a variety of franchises that will allow Sony to just pump out a billion movies that superficially check all the boxes that define &lt;em&gt;Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt;, it is done in conjunction with the development of Miles Morales himself and the central conflict that takes place within this story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that we’ve basically seen everyone but Marvel fail at this consistently, including any of the Sony Spider-Man films since Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man 2, it’s refreshing to see Sony finally deliver something worth watching. It’s basically the antithesis of &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&lt;/em&gt;’s wildly sporadic inclusion of supervillains purely for the purposes of setting up a franchise in place of solid storytelling. No matter how much insanity &lt;em&gt;Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt; crams into its story, it never loses sight of the emotional connection between Miles and his world. It is this attention to the heart of his journey that allows the emotional punches to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a secondary layer, &lt;em&gt;Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt; parallels the challenges of making a character who is different from the one that the world loves and accepts. It’s interesting to see how well they tap into this question of whether someone who is not &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; Spider-Man can be good enough to meet the expectations of a world that needs what Spider-Man has always been able to give them. This layer of meta-storytelling helps the emotional moments land meaningfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best parts of &lt;em&gt;Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt; are reinforced with a beautiful visual style that I enjoyed throughout. Though, it has to be said that while the scene composition and cell shaded 3d design looks absolutely beautiful, the actual animation uses a very stilted low framerate to give the impression of a comic flipping pages. If you pay careful attention to the trailer you will be able to see exactly what it’s like, and you should know that is representative of the entire film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get that they were trying to capture the sensation of comic books coming to life. There are moments where &lt;em&gt;Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt; delivers on that feeling of having the art walk right off of the pages and into the real world, but mostly it ends up just making all of that incredible cell shaded design feel like stop-motion. Or worse, just choppy. Sadly, it’s very distracting, and I was never able to stop thinking about it and become fully immersed in the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear a lot of people saying that &lt;em&gt;Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just one of the best Spider-Man movies ever, but maybe the best comic-book movie of the year. So, is it? No. &lt;em&gt;Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt; is VERY good, but I think you’d have to be especially craving a good Spider-Man movie for &lt;em&gt;Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt; to feel like it’s better than the likes of &lt;em&gt;Infinity War&lt;/em&gt;. If you go into the theater with your hopes that high, I think you’ll be disappointed. It’s an origin story within an origin story, with origin stories on the side.  Even the best origin story is still going to feel like territory that you’ve been to before, even if this is one of the better executions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, this is a very good film that has heart and style. Be sure to check it out, you’ll be happy you did.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/12/2018-12-11-mowgli-legend-of-the-jungle.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;For a movie that clearly aspires to say something unique through a classic tale, &lt;em&gt;Mowgli: The Legend of the Jungle&lt;/em&gt; stumbles hard when it counts. Sitting in both the director’s chair as well as playing the beloved character Baloo, Andy Serkis has produced a movie that has a pattern of finding hidden depths in its characters just before flattening them to the most boring two-dimensional representation possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FB1KTG-O1V0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to put out in front that &lt;em&gt;Mowgli&lt;/em&gt; is an enjoyable film. Many of the characters feel fresh plus the writing strives to find interesting things to say by contrasting them against each other. If Andy Serkis hadn’t tried so hard to do something new this would have been a forgettable, though competent, remake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;em&gt;Mowgli&lt;/em&gt; stands out most positively is in moments where it grants the characters great depth. There are a few times in which the dialog had so much punch that it hurt. It’s deeply unfortunate that everything that the film builds up is torn down and taken away by an ending that leaves a deep sense of dissonance with the rest of the work. Having all that depth yanked abruptly from you is jarring in a way that is palpable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting these beautiful characters is a talented cast delivering performances that stand out with the best parts of the film.  Cate Blanchett’s portrayal of Kaa (the great snake) stood out as my favorite, followed by Christian Bale as Bagheera and Matthew Rhys as Lockwood the hunter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I love Andy Serkis, I just can’t stop myself from comparing his interpretation of Baloo to Phil Harris, or even more recently Bill Murray. It’s a completely different interpretation of the character that simply doesn’t sit right for me. That comparison isn’t favorable for me. I have to admit that this may simply be personal bias, as I grew up with Baloo’s depiction as a lovable goof in some of my favorite formative works. Given that, I don’t feel right stating that Serkis’ performance didn’t work for me without also noting that it isn’t possible for me to judge that performance fairly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all of its stumbles, &lt;em&gt;Mowgli: The Legend of the Jungle&lt;/em&gt; is enjoyable. If you’ve enjoyed the previous incarnations of the classic story from Rudyard Kipling, then you will likely find something worth your time here. Though it stumbles, it does so primarily because it tries so hard and it is paradoxically these very failures that make the film worth your time as opposed to resulting in a forgettably uninteresting remake.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/11/2018-11-30-ralph-breaks-the-internet.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;A sequel to the intensely refreshing &lt;em&gt;Wreck it Ralph&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ralph Breaks the Internet&lt;/em&gt; is as emotionally complex and entertaining as you can get while still being a complete mess. I was tickled at the same time as I was disappointed. The jokes land while the emotional needs of the cast of characters resonate with important issues, but the plot is convoluted and just can’t hold it together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems with the plot start early on with the core character motivations. &lt;em&gt;Ralph Breaks the Internet&lt;/em&gt; has a few major themes: personal growth as you need to enjoy new things, remembering what’s special and important from your previous life as you move forward, struggling with your own value, and accepting the changes that people close to you go through. That’s a LOT to pack into a film, and maybe it could have been done well, but Ralph’s new adventure comes with a bunch more things to pack in: endless Disney branding, &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, Twitter, Facebook, eBay, Youtube, references, references, and more references.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While they were busy weighing down the film with complex themes and constant references, the writing team, unfortunately, seems to have forgotten to adhere to the themes of the original. Lessons and ideas from &lt;em&gt;Wreck it Ralph&lt;/em&gt; are casually disregarded for the character needs in this film. Even core ideas from &lt;em&gt;Wreck it Ralph&lt;/em&gt;, such as “Going Turbo” (the primary plot point from that film), are discarded casually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this results in what you might expect… a narrative that moves with the power of attention deficit disorder from one objective to the next as it morphs and evolves constantly over its runtime. &lt;em&gt;Ralph Breaks the Internet&lt;/em&gt; shifts unrecognizeably between each and every 5-minute interval. It’s almost impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ralph Breaks the Internet&lt;/em&gt; impressively manages to still feel somewhat cohesive until the end when it hits a wall where the writing just can’t resolve the conflicting themes within itself. Sarah Silverman’s Vanellope von Schweetz struggles with needing to solve her own problems, while Ralph remains the protagonist and is additionally positioned in a way where thematically he &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; to be the one to solve the problems as they are primarily his own. This paradoxical results in no one really being able to feel like the lead as everything breaks down at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds overly negative, so I really have to emphasize here, &lt;em&gt;Ralph Breaks the Internet&lt;/em&gt; is FUN. The jokes land, the characters are playful, the music is upbeat and breezy, and even the gag bits like the one with the Disney Princesses are playfully energetic. Most of what is wrong here will only linger on the back of your mind as you feel a vague sense that it all just isn’t working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, you’re really likely to enjoy &lt;em&gt;Ralph Breaks the Internet&lt;/em&gt;. It’s outright fun while being easily the most entertaining show in November. I feel bad talking so much about what doesn’t work, but these are the types of things I just haven’t been able to stop thinking about since the credits rolled. It’s the sort of &lt;em&gt;Jurassic World&lt;/em&gt; bad where it feels good but then the food poisoning just sits with you for days or weeks afterword unless you’re able to just put the entire thing out of your mind because it wasn’t important to you at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s the real tragedy because it should be important. &lt;em&gt;Ralph Breaks the Internet&lt;/em&gt; tries to tackle some hard subject matter. It just does it poorly. This movie has interesting things to say, but it just does so poorly enough that none of them work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to be that guy who says to avoid a film because of that. If you liked the first one and want more then turn your brain off and just enjoy the movie. Sure, you deserve better, but sometimes you get what you get. This one came close to being great, and it tried so very hard.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/11/2018-11-16-fantastic-beasts-the-crimes-of-grindelwald.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Out of all of the &lt;em&gt;Crimes of Grindelwald&lt;/em&gt;, and there are a lot, the one I find most unforgivable is just how boring the film is. Nothing this mediocre and lazy should also be this long. There’s no reason for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8bYBOVWLNIs&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not familiar, &lt;em&gt;Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald&lt;/em&gt; is the second film in a series spun off of the &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; franchise. The new series chronicles the adventures of Newt Scamander (played by Eddie Redmayne) as he chases down fantastical mythological creatures while a race war slowly builds up in the wizarding world between purebloods, half-bloods, and whatever new charming new slur for muggles that will feel fresh for a movie or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the first movie had quite a bit of entertaining play between Redmayne’s portrayal of Newt and the elaborate zoological additions to the Potterverse, its larger world-building didn’t work. Given that we’re going to get 5 of these movies I had hoped that we’d get through 3 of them before they turned hard into the cheaply written story centered around off-brand Voldermort. How wrong I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Crimes of Grindelwald&lt;/em&gt; dives hard into the race-war lite plot, spinning the rather generic background characters from the first movie front and center. The charming mythology building menagerie moments are relegated to a mere B plot as the writing gets ridiculously convoluted fast with people you barely cared about during the first movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to forcing the B plot from the first movie into the foreground without a narrative to carry it, &lt;em&gt;The Crimes of Grindelwald&lt;/em&gt; lacks any motivation to hold the plot together. The vast majority of movement through the story is achieved with Deus Ex Machina to poor effect. This method for plot progression isn’t new to the Potterverse, and it has been used to entertaining effect in the other films, but in the absence of an effective story the lack of connective tissue between the character actions and the plot progression stands out like a sore thumb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you primarily move characters around with plot devices or Deus Ex Machina it makes plot construction easier because you don’t have to care about why an event or action happens. That’s the entire beauty of that kind of lazy writing. Given that the majority of the film’s progression comes from literal magic, it is particularly amazing how convoluted the plot gets. If the writers don’t care about how anything happens, why is it so complicated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kid you not, the story is so over-complicated that it has to pause two-thirds of the way through to give 20 minutes of exposition about what is going on and who the characters are. It’s mind-blowing. Partly because the exposition still isn’t quite enough to figure out what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the acting is distractingly bad, but none of it is particularly good. I certainly can’t say that I enjoy Johnny Depp’s portrayal of David Bowie. Eddie Redmayne’s Newt Scamander and Jude Law as Dumbledore are the most entertaining performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the issues run deep through the heart of &lt;em&gt;The Crimes of Grindelwald&lt;/em&gt;, some may still enjoy the beautiful visuals. The cinematography is excellent at capturing a world that is rich with texture. The frames are well blocked and the visuals are imaginatively creative. Even the action is well crafted and entertaining even though it is cartoonish and lacks the grounding for it to feel suspenseful. I think a lot of viewers will be able to be entertained at least on a superficial level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d also be remiss to give credit to the universe for having some charm that is inherited. A few of the characters are endearing and the writers haven’t been able to completely bleed the appeal out of the setting. There is still some joy to be had in returning to Hogwarts, even if it is very little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I think there are many who may be able to enjoy &lt;em&gt;The Crimes of Grindelwald&lt;/em&gt; for at least one ride, I think the Amortentia will wear off quickly. For all its faults, the most damning is that it is boring. That’s a fault that I do not believe even casual audiences will be able to forgive.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/11/2018-11-14-widows.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Widows&lt;/em&gt; weaves a web with a strong core that’s a bit frayed around the edges. Coming out in a bit of a drought of criminal caper films against the likes of lighter fare such as &lt;em&gt;Ocean’s 8&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Widows&lt;/em&gt; will likely find an audience who will both appreciate and remember it despite its flaws. Both the strong acting and intense directing that define the experience far outweigh the nitpicks that keep it from greatness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nN2yBBSRC78&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director Steve McQueen manages to capture the action in a way that is grippingly fresh, and that is honestly 70% what I need. He captures chases in a way that pulls you right in without feeling jarring or uncomfortable. His structure for the physical space of the main locations is always clearly visible as he navigates that space so that it makes sense to the audience. For this type of caper flick to be enjoyable it’s very important that the audience feels like they understand what’s going on, and especially like they haven’t been cheated in any of the reveals as they happen. This really sets &lt;em&gt;Widows&lt;/em&gt; apart from other recent films such as &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/2017/04/11/going-in-style-2017/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Going in Style&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bolstering the directing is a fantastic cast putting in excellent performances. Viola Davis absolutely kills it, and her somber approach to the lead character of Veronica and Colin Farrel fantastically delivers a nuanced villain that is fascinating to watch. And Steve McQueen knows what he’s working with and will occasionally freeze the movie and look away so that these actors have the opportunity to deliver with their voices alone in a way that is captivating. The performances bridge the gap between good enough and downright good for the entire movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heist itself is pretty run of the mill, nothing special, but some of the character and plot details just sort of splinter at the edges of the story. I know and enjoy that the hook is women pulling off a crime in generally male roles, but the political nature of this flip is just a little too much at the forefront. Completely tangential details get the political treatment in a way that causes a feeling of artificiality. Almost all of the nuance of character development is between the characters played by Colin Farrel and Robert Duvall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, &lt;em&gt;Widows&lt;/em&gt; is definitely worth watching for its construction and performances, both of which are good enough to outshine the mediocre subject matter. Unfortunately, I think the little, frayed edges will keep it from being a classic, but those who like it will remember it fondly for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/11/2018-11-07-the-girl-in-the-spiders-web.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;There are so many great elements at work in &lt;em&gt;The Girl in the Spider’s Web&lt;/em&gt; that it is just beyond disappointing that it falls apart as a film. I really, really wanted to like this one because I am so on board with the vigilante female comic book hero that it isn’t even funny. “But Steve,” you would say, if my name were Steve, “&lt;em&gt;The Girl in the Spider’s Web&lt;/em&gt; isn’t based on a comic book.” To which I would reply that you’re right, it isn’t. But let’s talk for a minute about what it is…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XKMSP9OKspQ&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Girl in the Spider’s Web&lt;/em&gt; is a film adaptation of a novel commissioned by the publisher of author Stieg Larsson’s &lt;em&gt;Millenium&lt;/em&gt; novel series which started with &lt;em&gt;The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Millenium&lt;/em&gt; crime novels were all published posthumously after the death of Stieg Larsson and rose to rather astounding fame as the books struck a chord with a passionate audience. They were shortly followed by a film trilogy starring Noomi Rapace, the first of which was later remade in the US by David Fincher. And… you might be wondering exactly what you’d get from a story which was commissioned in those circumstances. What do you get from an unrelated author 8 years after the fact?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out you get something that very superficially captures an impressionist’s view of a character. If you watched the trailer from before, it’s important to note that the first part of that trailer is a near uncut excerpt of the opening of the film in which a wife beater is captured by the protagonist, Lisbeth Salander, after magically appearing in his home before she magically tears him to financial ruin by giving away all his money to the women he has wronged. This scene is reflective of the entire film… if you can turn off your brain completely it is visually impressive and emotionally satisfying. But how did she hack his bank accounts? How did she get in his home? Why do we care about any of the characters in this scene that don’t already have decades of history and multiple films from iconic directors trying to chisel them from nothing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cannot help but ask yourself those questions, then this film will leave you disappointed all the way through because the film will not give satisfactory answers to any of them. It doesn’t care how it gets from point A to point B, or the character motivations. The story is predictable in its plot construction with absolute junk for its connective tissue. No one who made this movie seems to have any interest how you get the main character from beginning to end so long as it looks cool while they’re doing it. Computers are treated as if they are magic and all of the characters in the film exist merely as plot devices. The nuanced character of Lisbeth Salander is functionally transformed into Batman. She even likes to disappear mid-conversation as though she were talking to Commissioner Gordon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what I mean when I call this a comic book movie. The reduction of Lisbeth Salander to an underground vigilante hero who fights alone and vanishes into the night with no one to love and no one who can truly love her is… frankly more at home in the mid-90s between &lt;em&gt;Batman Returns&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Spawn&lt;/em&gt;. For those of you thinking that this isn’t entirely a bad thing, I’m inclined to agree with you. I am so on board with a female dark knight of avenging justice that I desperately want to see a film like this work. We also had &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/2018/09/06/peppermint&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peppermint&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, which was also a trainwreck, though for entirely different reasons. This just isn’t it. At least it’s better than &lt;em&gt;Peppermint&lt;/em&gt;, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, if you can get past a movie that is 100% superficially invested in delivering that experience, you’ll probably be able to enjoy it. But the original works were rich and thoughtful crime dramas that were invested in suspending disbelief. They worked hard to give motive to every event, and tie the structure of their stories together with motivation as Lisbeth moved from scene to scene. They &lt;em&gt;cared&lt;/em&gt; that Lisbeth used realistic computer exploits and believable social engineering to accomplish her goals. If you can be happy with characters and stories that have been robbed of all depth, then, there is &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; here for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claire Foy acts her heart out as Lisbeth and captures the cold but constantly thinking demeanor of the character. No one else in the film even comes close to Claire’s performance. None of the actors are bad, they all do fine, but Claire is an absolute standout. On top of a perfectly acceptable cast of actors working competently, you also have excellent cinematography that crushes it with beautiful scenes. The action, while not spectacular, is still thrilling and fun to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there’s no thematic depth to the scene construction. Nothing to make you re-examine any of the events in the film. Everything is so morally unambiguous and flimsy that you never doubt anything at all. All that action and all those beautiful frame compositions are usually ruined by the director’s total lack of appreciation for the simplest details about how to move the story forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I sound extremely negative even though there really is a movie here that a lot of people will be able to enjoy. Part of it is because the use of computers as deus ex machina is a personal pet peeve of mine. Part of it is because I need a good reason to not care about plot construction and mediocre action is not a good enough reason. We deserve better as an audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst part about &lt;em&gt;The Girl in the Spider’s Web&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just that it’s bad. It’s that the writers and directors had everything they needed to make something great: an amazing concept, a beautifully rich and nuanced character, a history of writers and directors who got it right, and then they got it wrong because they just didn’t care enough about anything. And if they don’t care, then why should you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a choice, watch something better. Even if you are able to enjoy &lt;em&gt;The Girl in the Spider’s Web&lt;/em&gt;, there are more satisfying things you can spend your time on. Like sitting quietly alone in the dark. It’s not as entertaining, but you won’t feel so completely disappointed by what it could have been.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/10/2018-11-01-bodied.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bodied&lt;/em&gt; manages the near impossible by showing deep contempt for the rap battles that are its core subject matter while still getting the audience deeply invested into the climax of the film. If anything, director Joseph Kahn heavily explores a fantasticly ironic relationship between the nature of rap battles boisterous bragging and the lives of the rappers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oUry7CpMpCE&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before saying anything else, I have to say that &lt;em&gt;Bodied&lt;/em&gt; has a lot to say about modern race relations that I’m just not qualified to comment on. I just don’t know how to think or feel about it. I’m also not sure that the themes of the film are sincere as &lt;em&gt;Bodied&lt;/em&gt; appears to have a satirical thread which may indicate that everything it appears to support may well be done for humorous effect. What I can say is that as much as any other aspect of &lt;em&gt;Bodied&lt;/em&gt;, the discussion of political correctness and race relations kept me lost in thought through its entire runtime. And I think that’s a good thing, anything that makes you think long and hard, whatever its message, is a good thing. It’s discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, there are some fantastic questions that get raised about the damage that a single video of a smaller moment in a person’s life can change everything. That’s a powerful topic because we are more and more immersed in a world where it is increasingly plausible that your worst possible moment may be blown up to the world and you may be judged for a time where you are lost and confused and still trying to find out who you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing I’ll say regarding the story is that I was refreshed throughout the experience by the thoughtful and analytical approach that &lt;em&gt;Bodied&lt;/em&gt; uses to approach its subject. The film opens with a rap battle in progress between Behn Grymm and a forgettable opponent that is observed and commented on in real time by the main character, Adam. This opening makes it clear that the thoughtful approach is purposeful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the story, Joseph Kahn uses creative shots and animations to keep the conflicts engaging and visceral. The pacing does a fantastic job of getting the audience invested in the emotional impact of the various battles as they progress the story. It’s even more impressive that this is done even as the story emasculates its protagonists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole, &lt;em&gt;Bodied&lt;/em&gt; is a fascinating work that is both thoughtful and entertaining. The subject matter can be harsh and a lot of people may be turned off by the ideas. However, if you’re a fan of thought-provoking films with clever dialog that ask difficult questions, then &lt;em&gt;Bodied&lt;/em&gt; is definitely worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/10/2018-10-31-the-nutcracker-and-the-four-realms.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Though blunt to a fault as well as generally flawed, &lt;em&gt;The Nutcracker and the Four Realms&lt;/em&gt; is filled with warm sincerity wrapped around nightmare fuel. Director Lasse Hallström has created a visual work that harkens back to films like &lt;em&gt;Labyrinth&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Dark Crystal&lt;/em&gt; in how the use of stunning visuals creates an unsettling family film. Viewers with an appreciation for that darkness will find something to cherish despite its rough execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BXfxLIuNJvw&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I admire most about &lt;em&gt;The Nutcracker&lt;/em&gt; is a visual style that embraces uncomfortable visuals. While the original ballet is well known being a cherished Christmas tale, it seems few recall that it is tinged with shadows. Part of this is because the scariest parts of the ballet don’t translate to a modern audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Families today aren’t familiar with the filth of rats, and probably haven’t been for a few generations. Most children today haven’t seen a rat, and those that have probably have only seen them as clean well cared for pets. It makes translating the images that make it terrifying challenging, and I have to applaud &lt;em&gt;The Nutcracker and the Four Realms&lt;/em&gt; for attempting to retain those elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the willingness to use its visuals to chilling effect, there’s a sincerity and warmth to the film that is worth noting. Throughout the film, there are themes of self-actualization that get tarnished by how bluntly and repeatedly they’re delivered, but they still managed to feel like they’re touched with a hint of sincerity that keeps them from being wholly diminished. I walked out of the theater feeling just a hint warmer and happier than going in. Be warned, though, that you do have to wrestle with some of the problems with the film’s execution to get at that underlying sincerity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second to the repetition and blunt over explanation of basic background information is the acting. Morgan Freeman appears to actually be bored, but at least that’s a real feeling. No one else seems to be able to bring any truth to their characters, at best feeling hollow and perfunctory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t entirely the fault of the actors, though, as the writing ranges from mildly amusing to painfully bland. There just isn’t much there to work with. The majority of the humor is painfully dull-witted, though some moments are mildly amusing. I need to step back a minute, though, because it’s worth noting that this is a matter of perspective. Many of these jokes have roots in classics that I’ve been familiar with since I was a child, and there is definitely an audience for whom these gags will be the first time they hear them instead of the thousandth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nutcracker and the Four Realms&lt;/em&gt; dances a fine line where it will be different things to different people. Adults tired of the tropes within it will be painfully bored, while children are likely to get a film that will stick with them through their life. One day those children will revisit this film trying to see if they liked it because it was good or just because they didn’t know better and they’ll find that it was just fine. I just can’t be that hard on a film whose biggest sins are mediocrity. There’s so much worse out there, and there’s definitely an audience who deserves to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/10/2018-10-18-halloween.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Though refreshingly entertaining, &lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt; isn’t for everyone, but it isn’t meant to be. Filled with captivating cinematography, fun actors, and entertaining direction, there is a lot to like here. Director David Gordon Green feels like he gets what is supposed to make the franchise fun and entertaining, and it almost worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aMCLVSlk1Tk&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is most fascinating about the franchise is just how cavalier it is with continuity. The &lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt; franchise has had a large series of sequels as well as full reboots that are followed by &lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt; (2018) which is a sequel with selective continuity from only the original films. Kind of. &lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt; describes its own continuity and rewrites its history via exposition dialog and describes a series of events that don’t appear to have happened in any film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s &lt;em&gt;Superman Returns&lt;/em&gt; weird, but don’t worry about it, David Gordon Green doesn’t. The movie doesn’t suffer because of it. Just try not to think about it. I was able to not worry about it till after the movie and I’m still okay with it because &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; movie is cohesive. I don’t need it to make sense in the context of literally 40 years of films. I know there are some people that do need that, so just be aware. If you need to, think of it as a new reboot that starts with Michael Meyer’s second killing spree and writes its own prequel out in exposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, I love these kinds of mental gymnastics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, though, that’s the most interesting part of the story outside of the element of being part revenge film from the perspective of Jamie Lee Curtis’ character, Laurie Strode. Michael Meyers, a 40-year-old boogie man who has never said a word, is set free on Halloween night to kill again as his counterpart, his one-time victim Laurie Strode, hunts him down after spending her whole life in preparation for this confrontation. It’s fine. In fact, it’s downright fun for a concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s be brutally honest here, this franchise isn’t about the plot. The audience is here for the slashing. They’re here for a steady build of uncomfortable tension punctuated with brutal murders depicted with creative directing. You will get that in spades. If that’s all you want out of a good slasher, you’ll get it and that aspect is well done. There are very few jump-scares, and those jump-scares are more there for fun than to scare you. The film wants its premise to be what’s scary, and so the murders tend to be more fetishized by the director than surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My issues with &lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt; come more from the character of Michael Meyers himself rather than from anything else about the story, but I’ll wait to talk about that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I want to praise the cast. I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; Jamie Lee Curtis. Her film choices lately just leave me giddy and excited, and I’ve especially enjoyed her in the &lt;em&gt;Scream Queens&lt;/em&gt; tv show. She plays Laurie Strode with a somber tone. There are a few nods to the franchise, but fewer than you’d expect in this type of film that is trying to play off its history. Other standouts for me include Will Patton as Officer Hawkins and Haluk Bilginer as Dr. Sartain. Their strong performances are important as their characters have the most interaction and history with Laurie Strode and Michael Meyers, and they act primarily as the lens for what the audience understands and feels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all of these great elements, the passionate directing, the amazing cast, and the deeply fascinating relationship with its franchise, &lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt; just didn’t work for me. To me, a person who doesn’t speak for 40 years and whose only actions when they’re free to act are endless thoughtless murder isn’t evil. They’re not even a person. They’re a plot device or a machine. The film’s dialog regularly asks the audience to try and give motivation to Meyers with one hand and with the other hand it tells us that he is such pure evil that he has no motivation. You can’t have it both ways. But more importantly, you especially can’t have it the latter. Pure evil isn’t mindlessly killing people one at a time in order. There’s no method or motive to it. That’s at best nature, but at worst… it’s built entirely on an unhelpful understanding of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get what they want, too. They want to prey on that feeling you got when you were ten years old and telling stories about escaped mental patients down the street. That was a cool feeling… when you were ten. As a secondary objective, they want to appeal to the part of you that wants to live only for a minute inside of Michael Meyers and enjoy what he’s doing. It’s why the film doesn’t use its jump scares for the murders but takes just enough time with each kill to let the brutality of it sink in. But I’m not ten and I don’t have any desire to spend even a moment in Michael Meyers’ shoes, and so &lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt; just didn’t work for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with that criticism, though, I will say that the end was still incredibly entertaining as the style of movie shifts dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the latest &lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt; is as pure of a slasher as you can get, but this, unfortunately, can’t and won’t appeal to everyone. Its purity makes it incapable of rising above the slasher genre and finding anything truly deeper beyond its offerings. Its lack of anything deep to say about its subject is part of that purity. I will say this, it’s one of the very best examples of what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/10/2018-10-16-the-happy-prince.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;It feels trite to sum up &lt;em&gt;The Happy Prince&lt;/em&gt; as poorly paced given its entertaining performances and difficult subject matter but it is simply too sad for too long. I wish that the writing, directing, and editing had been as good as the talented acting and heartbreaking story. Written, directed, and starring Rupert Everett who is both the force propelling the film and the parachute holding it back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tXANCJQkUIE&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of the life of Oscar Wilde is a tragic one. He wrestled both with the prejudices that literally imprisoned him for his sexuality and severe substance abuse issues, the combined force of it all even likely killed him at far too young an age. It certainly stifled his creative voice too soon.  The film certainly conveys this nightmare, however, I cannot help but feel that by truncating the story to the most tragic time of his life that it is robbed of the punch that comes from just how brightly Oscar Wilde shined. The result is also nearly the full runtime of 105 minutes composed entirely of depression and misery broken up by the occasional witty barb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the pacing of the story, Rupert Everett’s portrayal of Oscar Wilde is invigorating. He’s passionate, clever, and charismatic. While none of the acting in the film is subpar, Everett’s performance shines so far and above the rest of the cast that the experience is uneven. He’s easily the pillar of the entire film. While the writing doesn’t give us the best of Oscar Wilde, the performance certainly contains enough of him that it is worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Rupert Everett’s acting elevates the film, his directing seems to sabotage his efforts at their worst and rarely does anything to support or improve the work. The biggest issues I noticed were inelegant cuts from one scene to the next. Usually, this happens when Everett tries to fade between two scenes with a visual similarity in order to tie them together but cannot quite technically make the fade work. At its best, though, his directing adds little to the subject matter merely competently conveying the mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;The Happy Prince&lt;/em&gt; is worth watching, its flaws will keep it from being particularly memorable or even meaningful. I’m hesitant to be so mean as to say that it feels made for TV, especially in an era when made for TV includes masterful works of storytelling, but I see little to justify a theater experience for this film outside of Everett’s performance as Wilde. If you greatly enjoy a tragedy you’ll likely be able to appreciate it despite its flaws, but I think few other audiences will find much to love here.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/10/2018-10-03-bad-times-at-the-el-royale.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Good news for you if you like a bad time because the &lt;em&gt;Bad Times at the El Royale&lt;/em&gt; are downright succulent. This slow-burning drama plays with viewers by drawing out suspense with intricate storytelling that will leave you leaning forward in your seat to see what’s next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/y7wzBVARwaU&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writer and director Drew Goddard binds his narrative together with a beautiful style of direction that uniquely blends the environment, story, and characters together with gripping scene composition. The El Royale hotel becomes a living and breathing character as the audience gets an intimate sense of its layout and personality even as everything is torn apart. You will be fascinated from the beginning to the end with this strange place that sits on the border between Nevada and California. This location brings out an otherworldly element to events that unfold inside its rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we’re left with after everything is said and done is a character-driven piece wherein the key players rip each other apart as the location shreds them into each other like a meat grinder pumping out the sweet, sweet sausage of a tight thriller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each cut is used to toy with you as a viewer, teasing you with a sharp and important event, then wrapping multiple stories around it from multiple angles before finally revealing the next step in the story. It’s maddening how Goddard drags you along with each and every reveal and fun, twisting turns. Goddard builds this house of narrative structure on a foundation laid with characters portrayed with fantastic actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly could not pick a standout from this cast. Jeff Bridges, Cynthia Erivo, Lewis Pullman, Jon Hamm, Dakota Johnson, Cailee Spaeny, and Chris Hemsworth all absolutely kill it. Every one of them finds the core of their character and brings out something beautiful that you can’t help but get wrapped up into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The music choice is good, but not amazing, with great tunes that set the time period. If the rest of the film weren’t so excellent I would probably count this as a positive, but with all the other elements of the film reaching such incredible heights, the music is  “only” very good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to ding &lt;em&gt;Bad Times at the El Royale&lt;/em&gt; for anything, it would be a lack of thematic resolution. It has things to say, and powerful moments where the characters voice something beautiful, but it just doesn’t run through the entire film, and the end doesn’t feel like it truly resolves anything. And by that, I mean, it doesn’t feel like it has anything to resolve. The characters you think of as the protagonists don’t have their core problems tied directly to the narrative or resolution of the film, leaving everything just a tad hollow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this is a great slow burn with a fun punch. &lt;em&gt;Bad Times at the El Royale&lt;/em&gt; is easy to recommend to fans of suspenseful drama that is good enough that almost anyone can find something enjoyable in it.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/09/2018-09-28-assassination-nation.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;The best horror films capture the fears of a generation and culture and &lt;em&gt;Assassination Nation&lt;/em&gt; dives head first into the horrors of our times with frightening effectiveness. Director Sam Levinson elevates his craft to astounding heights with energetic camera work, gripping scene composition, and unrelentingly tense pacing wrapped around a story about the increasingly unreliable nature of information as it destructively passes through the lens of public perception and groupthink judgment.  Viewer beware that &lt;em&gt;Assassination Nation&lt;/em&gt; is deeply upsetting to watch. Pay attention to the trailer, it is not joking about its trigger warnings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTmFKZmp1aE&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;em&gt;Assassination Nation&lt;/em&gt; excels the most is in its use of modern fears to build a narrative that is complex and painful. It rips into how everything in society today makes you afraid of yourself. You’re afraid of how people treat you, of the things you need to do to be accepted, afraid of not being what the world wants and also afraid of being what the world wants. You can’t be you and you can’t escape being you. It’s miserable. Everything constantly worse because of the unreliable narrative of the world… not any one character, but the very society that the story takes place in feels insubstantial. The era of fake news made manifest and amplifying everything that you’re already terrified of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam Levinson’s visual storytelling magnifies the intricate narrative while keeping it tight but frenetic. Why waste words when you can have three parallel scenes playing in unison with simultaneous threads tying together? His style imparts the full runtime with energy that highlights the best elements of the story while muting some of the weaker moments. I don’t believe I’ve seen this much style since &lt;em&gt;Scott Pilgrim VS The World&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to spend some extra time giving credit to Levinson for what’s accomplished here. One of the major challenges with a story like this is communicating all of the information that the viewer needs to track the action and narrative. The use of parrallel frames and layered scene composition filled with densely packed information communicates a story that is so much larger than would be possible without so much talent. You cannot watch this film passively because so much is communicated visually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, &lt;em&gt;Assassination Nation&lt;/em&gt; is punctuated with violence and sexuality that is confrontational as well as brutal bullying, assault, human objectification, and misogyny. The aggressive subject matter underscores and highlights all the nightmares that the film brings to life. I don’t say this casually, but you should not watch this film if you aren’t prepared to be uncomfortable at best and thoroughly sick at worst. Honestly, &lt;em&gt;Assassination Nation&lt;/em&gt; should make you upset. It drags you through so much trash that you can’t help but feel dirty on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a fan of horror, you cannot miss &lt;em&gt;Assassination Nation&lt;/em&gt; as it will help define a new era of films that dig into the fears of a modern age. Not for the faint of heart, if you’re up for a visceral and upsetting thrill ride through a modern nightmare definitely give it a watch.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/09/2018-09-18-the-nun.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to review a movie like &lt;em&gt;The Nun&lt;/em&gt; because it isn’t good, but it isn’t exactly bad either. Horror is a fascinating genre because it can mean many different things to many different people, and there are those who thrive on cheap thrills that are served with a cheesy creepy atmosphere. In a nutshell, that’s what &lt;em&gt;The Nun&lt;/em&gt; is. A low-stakes haunted house ride that’s fun to look at if you can get into just the right mood. It’s great on the right night and with the right people, but it has a very specific purpose for its existence and it isn’t good enough to rise above that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pzD9zGcUNrw&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s okay. Sometimes I’m in the mood for a goofy horror flick. But it’s important to know what it is so that you’re ready to be in that mood. The plot is thin and holey (full of holes, despite having nuns in it this movie is not in the least divine), the characters are two-dimensional with no common sense, the story is similar to a campfire ghost tale, and the set design is gothic to the point of being outright silly. It’s easy to point out the flaws with &lt;em&gt;The Nun&lt;/em&gt; because they are transparent and surface level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But Bob, “ you might say, if my name were Bob, “you just listed all of the elements of the movie! If all those things are bad, then why isn’t the movie bad?” The answer is that because some days you just want to enjoy something silly. Some days it’s okay when all a movie wants to do is find a fun little way to make you jump in your seat. And when it comes to that, &lt;em&gt;The Nun&lt;/em&gt; isn’t half bad. Some of its jumps are nicely executed and pulled off with a bit of creativity and misdirection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;em&gt;The Nun&lt;/em&gt; is going to be important to people who are heavily invested in the mythology of the universe of &lt;em&gt;The Conjuring&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a series that is inconsistent with tone but overall is better than it should be. This alone will be enough for fans of the worldbuilding for that universe. It’s not an incredible lore, but it is likely to be important to the upcoming &lt;em&gt;The Conjuring 3&lt;/em&gt; and possibly also be referenced in &lt;em&gt;The Crooked Man&lt;/em&gt;. I can’t help but feel that having a horror universe develop such a diverse continuity is fun and I’m glad to see it happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie is also full of moments that are fun to watch if you’re able to approach the movie with the right mindset. The trailer definitely shows off one of the better little scares, but it’s not the only one. Director Corin Hardy is also pretty good with building a sense of suspense, so if you’re able to turn your brain off there’s plenty of great tension to enjoy. And lastly, the acting is all very solid. The characters come to life, and this also helps a lot. Everyone puts out a performance that is entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nun&lt;/em&gt; is one of those movies that proves that a movie isn’t always just the sum of its parts. If you know what you’re going to watch and you are wanting exactly that, you’ll have fun, and that’s the important thing.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/09/2018-09-15-a-simple-favor.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Striking a strange balance between clever comedy and tense suspense thriller, &lt;em&gt;A Simple Favor&lt;/em&gt; manages to find a unique space that will be an instant classic to those who can appreciate it. It’s rare for a film to blend two opposing genres so beautifully, making it especially surprising to see director Paul Feig accomplish this, even if he can’t be said to have done so effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bkx0LtSXKYw&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deciding which is the bigger star of the movie between the writing and acting is a challenge. &lt;em&gt;A Simple Favor&lt;/em&gt; regularly hits a comedic moment right before dancing into the dark undercurrents of creepy character development or captivating narrative weaving. If director Paul Feig had pushed the movie a little more in either direction you’d have a decent suspense or a reasonably entertaining comedy, but it wouldn’t be quite as special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Feig does more than just hit the right tone between tension and laughs. He puts subtle touches into the humorous frames that leave you vaguely unsettled and he captures the tense moments with a sense of disorientation that drives the plot forward. That’s not to say that his direction is perfect. Though he has dramatically improved from his last major work, &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters 2016&lt;/em&gt; (It has a real subtitle, but it’s not worth learning or looking up because this is how people know it), he shows some consistency in his flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t say that it 100% works when Feig contrasts upbeat music with thriller style imagery or setup. This is emblematic of what appears to be a larger systemic issue. I don’t think that it’s so much of a failure to deliver a consistent emotion when it’s needed. The problem is that these scenes need silence and space to sink in and Feig appears to struggle with delivering that. You can see it in a few places where the scene needs a moment of silence or a little peace to give the audience a moment to unravel the information for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Paul Feig learns to really let a moment exist and give every scene the sense of weight it deserves, I believe he’ll be capable of making something beyond incredibe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on, it is important to give credit to Anna Kendrick who rocks her role as Stephanie Smothers. She brings a nice creepiness to a cheery character, and though it wasn’t as darkly serious of a role as I’d like to see Kendrick do, the role was excellent for showing off her range as an actress. Blake Lively kills playing opposite to Kendrick. The only weakness is with the child acting, which comes off as wooden and stiff. Fortunately, the editing minimizes the effect on the film in addition to the strength of the leads keeping everything together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;em&gt;A Simple Favor&lt;/em&gt; is a fantastic ride and I was on the edge of my seat for every minute of it. This one will find an audience that will remember it for their whole life for the charming balance it creates while delivering a tight and entertaining narrative. Be sure to catch this one.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/09/2018-09-12-the-predator.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;No matter what, &lt;em&gt;The Predator&lt;/em&gt; was going to be a fascinating film whether it was good or bad. It’s just not very often that you see a franchise span over a long period of time without rebooting. What do the creators think about the audience for such an iconic movie monster, and what do they want out of modern-day world building for that universe?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/50_Ala5BKBo&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the answer to that question is, “Not much.” What I found interesting was how the opening to &lt;em&gt;The Predator&lt;/em&gt; felt like it has the ingredients to capture the best parts of the franchise. Though the franchise started in 1987, making it just over 30 years old, it has only had 3 entries prior to &lt;em&gt;The Predator&lt;/em&gt; all of which share some core thematic values. When I think of &lt;em&gt;Predator&lt;/em&gt; and its successors I think of tense Science Fiction Suspense thrillers. &lt;em&gt;The Most Dangerous Game&lt;/em&gt;, but with creative aliens that stalk in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the opening for &lt;em&gt;The Predator&lt;/em&gt; hints at the chance of tension, the action for the film is devoid of grounding. The Predators march through action sequences with such ridiculous invincibility that it is impossible to feel any sense of apprehension or concern. While they were ethereal and elusive in all their previous movies, here they are front and center and are so ridiculously overpowered that it is atmosphere breaking. On top of all of this, the narrative is so loosely composed that it’s impossible to believe that there’s any kind of coherent direction for the characters, much less a theme of predation that is the driving core of the Predator films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Predator&lt;/em&gt; has the worst kind of plot in that it completely falls apart as soon as you get a moment to think about it after all of the action, clever dialog, and entertaining acting fade away. It’s important to note here that I enjoyed watching the movie. I was entertained by the banter and greatly appreciated the elements that the film succeeded in preserving from the franchise, but the story is just the worst. It has nothing to say about the universe, it has nowhere interesting to go with the characters, and the strange and out of place social commentary about global warming feel ridiculously thin and contextually inappropriate. All of the connective tissue from scene to scene is written so lazily and with so little care for what anything means that there is absolutely nothing of substance here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2018/09/the-predator-attacks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Predator Attacks&quot; title=&quot;The Predator Attacks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writer and Director of &lt;em&gt;The Predator&lt;/em&gt;, Shane Black has roots with the series as he both played in and contributed writing to the original film. Shane Black’s writing style is iconic and identifiable and watching the original movie you can clearly identify any of his contributions. In addition to intense Science Fiction suspense, this type of cutting dialog has also been a staple of the franchise, and one that I am happy to say is actually present in &lt;em&gt;The Predator&lt;/em&gt;. I would go so far as to say that the exchanges between the characters may be one of the only reasons this movie is worth watching at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that fantastic dialog is delivered well by a collection of truly fun actors. I just wish their characters had some kind of use other than sharing Shane-Black-style quips. Sterling K. Brown stole every single scene he was in as the lead government agent, and the character acting from all of The Loonies is outstanding. Even if no one could bother to give them a genuinely compelling reason to work together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I also want to give some credit to &lt;em&gt;The Predator&lt;/em&gt; for having real gore. I’m talking people cut and half and intestines slowly unraveling out, heads with spinal columns ripped out of bodies, people just shredded to bits by furious monstrosities. I’m talking the type of gore we haven’t seen since the 80s in really fantastic over the top Science Fiction flicks like &lt;em&gt;Total Recall&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Robocop&lt;/em&gt;, and even the original &lt;em&gt;Predator&lt;/em&gt; came out in the 80’s. The type of shocking visuals that can give a great movie a real punch and make it extra memorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important part of that sentence is that the movie has to be good even without the gore. These visceral elements do little to nothing without anything of substance to enhance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a complete shame that the tight dialog and hyper-violent gore have such a thin and stupid movie to hold up. And really… they’re just not enough. There’s a good chance you’ll enjoy watching this movie, I know I did, but it will not stick with you. It will begin fading away almost as soon as you walk out of the theater, and leave you with nothing to think about or even really to talk about on its own merits. And that is sad. There are better movies out, give them a watch.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/09/2018-09-06-peppermint.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if “NRA Fetish Film” counts as a genre, but between &lt;em&gt;Taken&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Peppermint&lt;/em&gt; director Pierre Morel is certainly making a case for it. &lt;em&gt;Peppermint&lt;/em&gt; is an absolute blast for viewers looking for a violent ride through vigilante justice with a gender-swapped equivalent to &lt;em&gt;The Punisher&lt;/em&gt; that will set people on edge who are uncomfortable with the idea of white people justifiably and remorselessly gunning down cartoonishly evil minorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/eeBMQpzoEXQ&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it’s important to say that &lt;em&gt;Peppermint&lt;/em&gt; is well-paced and filled with intense action. Most viewers will be primarily concerned with how entertaining the film is, and taken at face value it feels like a live-action comic book. The action sequences are choreographed so as to be fun and the major plot points are framed in clear and unambiguous terms. The technical construction is on point with solid use of color, composition, and direction captures the story in a way that conveys exactly what is intended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it is also very much worth noting that the acting is solid and entertaining throughout. Jennifer Garner rocks as Riley North as a dramatic lead as well as an intense action star. Moreover, the child acting is excellent with a fantastic portrayal of Carley North by Cailey Fleming. The biggest criticism I can aim at the acting is the tragic stereotyping of latin gang membership, however, I don’t think it would be fair to level that at the actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, all of these positive elements are severely undermined by 2 major issues: A story that delivers narrative through heavy-handed exposition that is dismissive of important details and a framing device that glorifies racially slanted vigilantism. I think that the things a movie says with its narrative are incredibly important and &lt;em&gt;Peppermint&lt;/em&gt; fails thoroughly on this level. The film delivers a childish expectation of justice through a movie that is targeted at adults, reinforcing negative and unproductive stereotypes while advocating that might makes right without reservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’d like to dive into exactly how this movie does this I don’t think that it’s possible without getting into heavy spoilers. Given this, I’d like to talk about this movie again in an editorial. Suffice it to say that all of the critical information is given through expositional dialog, the major plot points are thin and unbelievable, and all of the characterizations are cartoonishly one dimensional. Even modern children’s cartoons avoid being so ridiculously heavy-handed with their subject matter. The demonization of Latin-American gang members is particularly tone-deaf toward any of the issues that create this climate and of the demographics driven to this kind of lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the complex issues that go into what causes gangs to form, how they’re structured, and the impact of social programs and regulation on their existence, portraying a white woman resolving her issues with an ethnically slanted gang by mowing them down with what is described as “exclusively military grade hardware” is problematic, at best. At worst, this propagates stereotypes that are unproductive as solvable with deeply inhumane violent power fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And those are just the ethical issues with the plot. From a pure construction standpoint, it is highly disappointing to have so little care given for basic cause and effect. Basic things are treated with heavy-handed and almost slapstick justification. A lot of viewers will be able to completely turn their brain off and overlook this for the action and pacing, but even the most basic review of the events of the film is outright silly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, if you can completely shut your brain off, or generally do not give the substance of a movie any thought, then you’re likely to find a fun summer action flick. Additionally, those who need a female power fantasy will find something here as there is definitely a gap in this genre. There is most definitely an empowering aspect here that is worth note. However, I’d suggest that anyone who wants more from their movies and demands more from filmmakers give &lt;em&gt;Peppermint&lt;/em&gt; a pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Nun&lt;/em&gt; is the latest entry produced by James Wan into the extended universe of &lt;em&gt;The Conjuring&lt;/em&gt;. For those unfamiliar with his productions, they tend to be solid and well-executed horror films. The trailers for &lt;em&gt;The Nun&lt;/em&gt; are already promising for fans of a good jump scare with a little bit of a twist, and there’s every reason to believe that this will at minimum be above average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bad:&lt;/strong&gt; Producer James Wan is credited as a writer and his films occasionally rely heavily on jump scares over substance. Additionally, director Corin Hardy’s short career has very few credits and is a bit of an unknown. There’s a fair chance that the core of &lt;em&gt;The Nun&lt;/em&gt; will be the substance lite jump scare style of a haunted house ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good:&lt;/strong&gt; The intense premise of this film and the vivid imagery in its trailer give off all the vibes of an intense claustrophobic horror, and the film has already won some awards at Cinepocalypse and FrightFest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bad:&lt;/strong&gt; We can also see from the marketing of this film that its low budget is a major aspect here, and it’s hard to tell how that will play out in the full movie. While it has earned some awards, these are from genre-specific festivals and often highly dependent on the competition at the time. This could end up being a pretty cheap-and-cheesy that falls flat on amateur acting and unable to hold it together through its editing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good:&lt;/strong&gt; A look a the life of Neil Armstrong that features performances from Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy. The strength of the acting alone could be enough to make &lt;em&gt;First Man&lt;/em&gt; worth a watch. It’s directed by Damien Chazelle who has given us outstanding films such as &lt;em&gt;La La Land&lt;/em&gt; and features writing from Josh Singer who is credit with films such as &lt;em&gt;Spotlight&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bad:&lt;/strong&gt; As much as we loved &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/articles/2016/12/15/la-la-land-2016/&quot;&gt;La La Land&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/articles/2017/12/19/the-post/&quot;&gt;The Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, these films may give us a picture of where &lt;em&gt;First Man&lt;/em&gt; could fall flat. The most likely failure will be a film that fails to be as much or more than the sum of its parts. Very unlikely to be bad, there is a fair chance that it just won’t be as good as it could be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good:&lt;/strong&gt; We’re starting to see some incredible performances from the current cast, and there’s a tremendous opportunity to blend it with an out of this world soundtrack from a band that produced all-time classic hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bad:&lt;/strong&gt; This project has publicly lost some incredible talent, such as Sacha Baron Cohen, specifically because of creative differences over the intended purpose of the film. The talent producing it may not have the creative freedom to say anything important or even particularly interesting. Additionally, director Bryan Singer has rarely risen above mediocre in the past two decades, frequently producing thin and superficial films with little merit. We could very well end up with a lazy cash in on the catalog of a once great musical group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good:&lt;/strong&gt; A gender flip of &lt;em&gt;The Punisher&lt;/em&gt;, one of the most controversial and challenging characters in comics? Yes, please. Sign me up. A well-written movie could use this as a lens to make some pretty scathing criticisms of society, justice, and social norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bad:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you really think that’s what we’ll get? It’s almost guaranteed to take the superficial elements of vigilante crime thrillers and fail to say anything interesting at all about the nature of vigilanteism or how the perception of it is affected by the gender change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good:&lt;/strong&gt; More Jack Black and Cate Blanchette, please. There’s a fun cast here that has the talent to do a lot with some interesting writing and directing, and director Eli Roth has some deeply fascinating producing and directing credits to his name. He has the talent and history to bring an interesting darkness to children’s films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bad:&lt;/strong&gt; Writer Eric Kripke has mostly written cheap horror and supernatural episodes. With this as the weakest link, we’re likely to see the worst elements of the genre come out and get a fairly lifeless children’s film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good:&lt;/strong&gt; The story of drug kingpin and FBI informant Richard Wershe Jr. is likely to be a hell of a ride, especially when backed with the talent of Matthew McConaughey and Jennifer Jason Leigh. At this point in his career, I’d literally watch almost anything with Matthew McConaughey in it on the strength of his choices of film to contribute to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bad:&lt;/strong&gt; This is another one of those movies where it’s very easy to construct a final product that is less than the sum of all of its parts. A historical drama with a director with very sparse credits that are mostly TV crime dramas could be a non-starter. Be prepared for a straightforward film that fails to find anything meaningful to say about its subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good:&lt;/strong&gt; An insane cast that includes Chris Hemsworth, Dakota Johnson, Jon Hamm, Nick Offerman, Jeff Bridges, Cynthia Ervo, Cailee Spaeny, and Lewis Pullman that manages to drip with style and with hints of a plot that could suck you in. Writer-director Drew Goddard has worked on &lt;em&gt;Cabin in the Woods&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cloverfield&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Good Place&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Martian&lt;/em&gt;, displaying a strong grasp of captivating drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bad:&lt;/strong&gt; Drew Goddard is still a little green, and a lot hangs on his work as both the writer and director. Given his shorter list of credits, it’s hard to say what could go wrong here as he hasn’t had a lot of opportunities to show what he has to say with so much creative control. With so many creative voices and names here, I’d be worried about the number of parts in the film and the capacity to use every actor to their fullest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Good:&lt;/strong&gt; The return of a franchise responsible for some of the most memorable action films of the 80’s and 90’s and a truly beloved horror character is hard to ignore. As icing on the cake, Shane Black (who has written for &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Last Action Hero&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Nice Guys&lt;/em&gt;) is working as the director and contributing to the writing. Shane Black has had one of the strongest voices in the action crime genre, particularly because of his wit and ability to find a deeply human element in his subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bad:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a franchise that has been struggling. With only one real entry in the last 30 years, &lt;em&gt;Predators&lt;/em&gt;, it’s fair to say that the core of these movies is non-existent. Without a real identity to tie the movies together, the audience for &lt;em&gt;The Predator&lt;/em&gt; has wildly fractured expectations. For a studio film like this, that can have a dramatic impact on the restrictions that the studio places on the writing and directing. Finally, the main plot point appears to be a gimmicky “bigger, badder predator”, which is hard to be excited about. The question is just how much life Shane Black can possibly breathe into this property.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/08/2018-08-26-the-happytime-murders.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Happytime Murders&lt;/em&gt; is classified as a Mystery/Crime but is really an adult, crass comedy released by Henson Alternative that attempts to bring together the childhood nostalgia of puppet-related joviality and graphic adult humor. With many felt-filled intimacies, it’s safe to say that this film is not one you’ll want to bring the whole family to enjoy. However, if you’re looking for a crude, gut-busting film to go see with friends, this may be your golden opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lpAdoEXUBcE&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot of the movie begins with a series of murders happening to the cast of the in-world sitcom “The Happytime Gang”. There is a race to figure out who’s committing these crimes and stop them. L.A private investigator Phil Philips, who is paired with his former partner Connie Edwards, embarks on a mission to find the culprit and bring them to justice. The duo then proceeds to end up in many cringy scenarios of ‘in the right place in the wrong time’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because this movie never aspires to be more than a crude attempt at comedy, whether or not it’s enjoyable on any level for you will depend a lot on your sense of humor and subject matter you feel you can overlook. Be forewarned that you’ll experience graphic pornography performed by puppets, incest jokes, and content that absolutely would not be acceptable if it were portrayed solely by human actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the film makes many small attempts at pointing out societal inequality, it quickly divulges away from that topic to more absurdity. It’s almost as if the film-makers intentionally avoided touching on the serious issue they so clearly alluded to. There were many opportunities to create a serious moment, that would have sent a strong message, but were quickly lost in the flood of lewd content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I want to say that the humor in this movie is well-thought-out and clever… I regretfully have to admit that the content borderlines on childish. With scenes that leave little to the imagination and blatantly-insensitive content, it’s no wonder this film has yet to beat its contemporary, Crazy Rich Asians, in the box office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its shortcomings, &lt;em&gt;The Happytime Murders&lt;/em&gt;, just like all others, has its own audience. While I disagree with small parts, overall, this movie is funny. Hopefully, Henson Alternative will listen to their viewers and create better-quality content for their newly-acquired fanbase. In my humble opinion, this movie is definitely a must see for those who enjoyed The Muppets in their youth.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/07/2018-07-09-sicario-day-of-the-soldado.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;If all you need is 2 hours of pure tension with no release or meaningful resolution, then &lt;em&gt;Sicario: Day of the Soldado” is the perfect movie for you. Well composed with excellent acting, cinematography, and action, this follow-up to *Sicario&lt;/em&gt; almost does enough right to overcome the things that it does wrong. Unfortunately, it doesn’t quite get there and will only satisfy a particular niche market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sIMChzE_aCo&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Day of the Soldado&lt;/em&gt; is a military suspense/drama about a team that is attempting to undermine Mexican drug cartels by performing black ops missions with the intent of causing the cartels to turn on each other. The major tension of the movie comes from an increasing divide between Matt Graver (the leader of the operation, portrayed by this summer’s rockstar Josh Brolin) and his operative Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). Nearly the full runtime of the film is dedicated to pushing these characters from being on the same side into a fundamental clash of motivations that feel like they can only end in a final nail-biting conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest issue with the film is that it lacks a resolution that matches either the tone or concludes the story. I happen to greatly enjoy a movie that isn’t necessarily satisfying as long as the conclusion changes how you feel about the movie leading up to that point. In fact, I would go so far as to say that I highly respect a film that isn’t afraid of having an ending with greater meaning at the expense of a feeling of resolution. However, I don’t feel that the ending of &lt;em&gt;Sicario: Day of the Soldado&lt;/em&gt; accomplishes anything meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two hours of intense music constantly pushing me to the edge, eagerly awaiting an explosive resolution, the film ends with a whimper instead of a bang. The end doesn’t even have a thematic or narratively appropriate ending to the plot. It’s a strange cut to a b-plot that implies that the movie was always about what it means to be and become a Sicario, when, in fact, we never get a sense of that from anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2018/07/benicio-del-toro-contemplates-what-this-movie-could-have-been.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Benicio Del Toro contemplates what this movie could have been.&quot; title=&quot;Benicio Del Toro contemplates what this movie could have been.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were major mood killers for me because they undermined everything I wanted from &lt;em&gt;Day of the Soldado&lt;/em&gt;. Outside of this, the rest of the movie is pretty fantastic and will appeal strongly to a crowd who is starving for what this movie does deliver: grounded violence with intense physicality and heart-stoppingly tense conflicts. Every other scene is a powerfully well-directed action setpiece with stomach-churningly impactful visuals. Characters are blown up, knocked down with believable force from firearms, and struggle with wounds that are devastating to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With every aspect considered, &lt;em&gt;Sicario: Day of the Soldado&lt;/em&gt; is an underwhelming entry into the genre that will only satisfy those who desperately need intensely physical violence and constant tension to the point that they do not need a satisfying resolution. Sadly disappointing, but not without merit for those craving that very specific kind of movie.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/06/2018-06-28-sorry-to-bother-you.markdown":"&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Be warned, &lt;em&gt;Sorry to Bother You&lt;/em&gt; is really a SciFi horror with disturbing and upsetting imagery and ideas disguised as a comedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sorry to Bother You&lt;/em&gt; is a gut-wrenching film that left me reeling for hours after I left the theater. The truth is, I may have left the theater, the film hasn’t left me. Director Boots Riley digs deeply into issues of racial identity and individuality which shifts wildly into an examination of exploitative consumer culture. This is a deep and thoughtful SciFi horror that bils itself as a comedy, and that is going to make a lot of people really unhappy when they see it. I know I am among the minority of people who enjoy having their expectations twisted out of control and taken to a horrifying place, so take it with a grain of salt when I say that I LOVE this movie. I love it for all the reasons that I suspect many people will hate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is perfectly okay if you hate it. There is a very real chance that you didn’t get the movie you thought you were going to see, and you do not deserve to be lied to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/enH3xA4mYcY&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to horror I strongly prefer a story that leaves me uneasy and filled with questions and doubts about who I am and where we’re going as a society. &lt;em&gt;Sorry to Bother You&lt;/em&gt; subverted all of my expectations, transforming like a caterpillar into a butterfly before my very eyes. It very much starts as the comedy in the trailer, racially charged and even deeply intelligent in the way it discusses the way society treats people of color. I’m completely unqualified to unpack everything happening here because every second of storytelling is layered with subtext and multi-layered communication that has to be unraveled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, about halfway through the film, the story bursts out of its shell in ways that are bizarre and unpredictable. I’m not going to spoil a second of it, you have to see it to believe it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the story and plot are both engaging, smart, and scathing indictments of society in the vein of satirical works like &lt;em&gt;RoboCop&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Running Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sorry to Bother You&lt;/em&gt; bleeds style of its eyes. The merging of direction, cinematography, and music make it a pure joy to behold. I had a smile plastered on my face for the whole roller-coaster ride of an experience thanks to the remarkable craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive article-pic&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/2018/06/sorry-to-bother-you.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sorry to Bother You&quot; title=&quot;Sorry to Bother You&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functionally, this movie is well made on every single level. It is art from the ground up, with every frame lovingly composed and set to music that has your blood pumping, seen through shots that invest you in the emotion of the scene, and acting that helps deliver the creepy vision of a word gone mad. It’s breathtaking to see a challenging work of art where talented creators are allowed to use their craft to deliver on themes and ideas, ultimately delivering a narrative that is able to say something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There honestly isn’t a better word to describe &lt;em&gt;Sorry to Bother You&lt;/em&gt; than roller-coaster because of how rapidly it takes you from falling on the floor laughing, to cringing through the dark and uncomfortable social situations, to being outright sick to your stomach at the unflinching nightmare. &lt;em&gt;Sorry to Bother You&lt;/em&gt; is a must see for horror fans that is going to have me thinking about it over and over again. While many viewers will dislike and reject this film, as much for the challenging views it portrays as for how it unexpectedly subjects you to a terrifying dystopian present, &lt;em&gt;Sorry to Bother You&lt;/em&gt; is an incredible film that deserves to be remembered and discussed. For those of you who are able to enjoy what it really is, despite how it was marketed to you, you’re going to end up with a film you may treasure for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/06/2018-06-26-jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fallen Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; reminds me of  a quote from &lt;em&gt;Multiplicity&lt;/em&gt;: “You know how when you make a copy of a copy, it’s not as sharp as… well… the original?” This is the fifth movie in the &lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt; franchise, and up till now they have all felt like pale imitations of the original, none of them capturing that special magic, and each a little fuzzier than the last. Following that trend, &lt;em&gt;Fallen Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; is not as well made as the first &lt;em&gt;Jurassic World&lt;/em&gt;. Weirdly, though, I liked it more. While the pacing is awkward and many of the plot points are weird or nonsensical, &lt;em&gt;Fallen Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; revels in its use of dinosaurs from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas &lt;em&gt;Jurassic World&lt;/em&gt; was all about trying to be &lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; is about trying to save the dinosaurs from &lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt;. That metaphor really works beyond the movie, too. Every movie up till now has always been pretty similar, about how to deal with these genetic creations inside of a zoo, but &lt;em&gt;Fallen Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; is about letting them loose.  The playfulness of this message was so energizing to me, that I found myself loving the film despite its issues with pacing and character development. In fact, I have to say that I have never been more excited to see where a franchise is going to go than I am after seeing &lt;em&gt;Fallen Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nerv5YEiJok&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precisely because &lt;em&gt;Fallen Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; is about getting away from the island, it has to start there, but it doesn’t have very much to say about the island or while it’s on the island. This creates narrative problems, too, because parts of the plot have to happen there, but in order to work, those parts of the movie are noticeably thin. But more than that, director J.A. Bayona never feels comfortable with any of the events in the story, causing the whole work to feel a bit like Frankenstein’s monster, but not in a cool or deliberate way. The story moves from plot point to plot point haphazardly; and, by the end, it doesn’t really matter who is a bad guy or why. The villains are the most run of the mill and average part of this film and easily the second largest problem with its construction behind the editing and pacing of the plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the protagonists aren’t handled well, as they are dramatic shifts from who they were in the last movie. Not that this is wholly bad, as the characters of Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were some of the problems with &lt;em&gt;Jurassic World&lt;/em&gt;, it’s just a little jarring. And it certainly doesn’t help that the whole plot of the island itself being destroyed in the first act feels like a pure plot device that didn’t have any buildup in its predecessors. These things bothered me, along with other story elements that I can’t get into without spoilers, but suffice it to say that the issues here are present throughout the movie, representing a consistent issue instead of one that is minor or isolated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of that said, &lt;em&gt;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; isn’t wholly without suspense or quality craftsmanship. While it’s often narratively broken, the moment to moment action is well put together and intense. There’s beautiful cinematography here, with some genuinely heartbreaking scenes and beautiful frames that display a deep fondness for the dinosaurs, even if they aren’t real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/2018/06/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom.jpg &quot; alt=&quot;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom&quot; title=&quot;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More discriminating fans will be turned off by the issues with quality that will go overlooked by a significant portion of the movie-going audience. With that said, there is something fun and amazing here that may be worth overlooking those flaws, even if you are the type of viewer who would normally be turned off by poor pacing and plot construction. I had a fun time, and I definitely recommend giving it a watch if you’re looking for a good time with great sci-fi monsters.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/06/2018-06-09-hotel-artemis.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;The most satisfying aspect of &lt;em&gt;Hotel Artemis&lt;/em&gt; is the beautiful world building. Almost totally absent from the trailer, writer/director Drew Pearce creates a vivid and believable sci-fi universe that I already crave more of. The blend of pure talent from the cast, the gritty near-future setting, and effective storytelling prove that you can create a compelling film with even the most basic of stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kUBowkexpkE&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every part of the world of &lt;em&gt;Hotel Artemis&lt;/em&gt; lives and breathes in a way that is believable. Everyone is surrounded by screens and tools that they take nearly for granted, medical technology that feels like the future come-to-life, but without feeling like deus ex machina. The story for &lt;em&gt;Hotel Artemis&lt;/em&gt; serves entirely as a framework on which to build the universe around the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set in a world where Los Angeles is disintegrating, &lt;em&gt;Hotel Artemis&lt;/em&gt; follows the story of a pair of wounded bank robbers as Nurse Jean (Jodie Foster) cares for them in her daily routine of maintaining a black-market members only hospital for criminals during the city-wide water riots. The straightforward story is purely a vehicle for exploring the characters and setting. The plot takes its time unfolding, giving plenty of time for developing each character and their motivations. This is one of the better ways to use an excellent cast like the one that appears here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It shouldn’t surprise anyone that Jodie Foster’s performance stands far and above the others, especially given that her character has the most nuanced writing. Acting isn’t always a competition, though, and everyone contributes meaningfully to the narrative in a way that plays to their strengths as actors. Between &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;, and now &lt;em&gt;Hotel Artemis&lt;/em&gt;, Dave Bautista is quickly becoming a favorite actor of mine. I look forward to seeing him in all kinds of roles as he displays quite the range of ability and an entertaining screen presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/2018/06/jeff-goldblum-hotel-artemis.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jeff Goldblum - Hotel Artemis&quot; title=&quot;Jeff Goldblum - Hotel Artemis&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zachary Quinto is everything you probably loved about him before. He’s a solid pick who has a brooding character that you love to hate, and it’s fun to watch a film that knows exactly how to use that. Do I even have to say anything about Jeff Goldblum? He’s great. He’s great in everything. And this is just scratching the surface. Every actor in this has fans who are getting exactly what they love from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this talented acting is put to fantastic use by the director, who uses every aspect of their on-screen presence for storytelling. Whenever a director tells me about a character with the expression on their face and the way their movement interacts with the camera, that is a win, and it happens throughout the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/2018/06/fantastic-masks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fantastic masks!&quot; title=&quot;Fantastic Masks - Hotel Artemis&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only regret is that there just wasn’t more substance to the story. This isn’t a bad thing, and I don’t think many people will care given how every other aspect of the experience shines; but, I don’t think it’s possible to say more with your story while also getting all of the other aspects right. Hopefully later entries into this universe will push more limits with their stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Total Recall&lt;/em&gt; vibe that the whole experience gives off is just so rare and delightful that &lt;em&gt;Hotel Artemis&lt;/em&gt; scratches a deep itch in a way that leaves you craving more. I already want a sequel and to learn more about these characters and this place. This sci-fi action is an instant classic and a must watch for anyone who enjoys a science-fiction adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/06/2018-06-06-hereditary.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;A lot of different movies try to be scary; but, once in a while, something special comes along that aspires to be truly horrifying. Not only does &lt;em&gt;Hereditary&lt;/em&gt; aspire to horrify, it accomplishes its goals beautifully. Well, beautiful is a subjective term. In this case, beautiful means to be deeply captivating in its grotesque imagery. &lt;em&gt;Hereditary&lt;/em&gt; enthralls with a story that blurs the line between madness and the supernatural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/V6wWKNij_1M&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pacing for &lt;em&gt;Hereditary&lt;/em&gt; is similar to that of &lt;em&gt;The Exorcist&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Rosemary’s Baby&lt;/em&gt;. Every scene is used to build the tension and tell the story, and none is wasted on cheap scares. When &lt;em&gt;Hereditary&lt;/em&gt; wants to scare you, it will do it methodically and deliberately, often preparing you for what you’re about to see. It’s ballsy to give the audience so much time to imagine what they will see next before confidently competing with their imagination. You will know that something horrible is coming up, the character in the scene will respond to it as the audience is allowed to connect with the expression on their face, and then you’ll be given time to soak up what you just saw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowing the audience the breathing time to soak in your movie is incredibly refreshing, and it has put director Ari Aster on my radar.  Few things are as amazing as a director who truly and deeply loves their craft. In additions to mastering the pacing o the narrative, Ari Aster draws parallels between the world of the story and doll houses. This connection is supported in almost every frame of the film. The clinical distance from feeling like an audience looking into a tiny world and at the pieces used to build it is used to fantastic effect in how it allows you to experience the horror through a sort of emotional barrier, making it feel numb and allowing you to feel it on a broader spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the directing, the story shows a great appreciation for mental illness. It plays with dysfunction in the background and rarely openly discusses it, leaving thoughtful viewers with seeds of doubt that run counter to the plot and text of the story. I would love to talk more about the story, but the plot is involved and meticulous, preventing it from being explored without spoiling it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is well supported by a cast that is very talented. Toni Collette kills it in the lead role. She communicates so many layers of text and subtext in her nuanced character, and it’s a joy to watch her take a descent into madness. Gabrielle Byrne plays her husband and captures a patient and loving demeanor that is deeply identifiable as the world wears down on him. While those are the standouts, there were no weak links here, and everyone’s performance builds up the core of the film to deliver something special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hereditary&lt;/em&gt; is something special. A horror film that stands out as some of the best work in the genre, an accomplishment in fantastic directing and vivid acting that brings a nightmare to life. Horror fans will remember this one for decades to come and it should stand out as a landmark in the genre because of how it marries substance with style. &lt;em&gt;Hereditary&lt;/em&gt; is a must watch for everyone who can stomach it.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/06/2018-06-04-how-to-talk-to-girls-at-parties.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite writers, and his style has lead to the creation of some works of art that haunted me for years to come. &lt;em&gt;How to Talk to Girls at Parties&lt;/em&gt; ends up being a quirky piece of science fiction that plays things just a little too safe, despite having some definitely weird and uncomfortable imagery.  Only the concept and costume design stand out, and that’s pretty unfortunate given how often the movie charms and delights. When it’s over you’re left craving something more substantial, making it feel like it’s just an appetizer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nWzHaRM8jeo&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything that’s great in the trailer is good in the movie, but there’s nothing more substantial than that. There’s more of it, but not &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; of it. That really left me disappointed, because there were some moments of the film that leaned to the creepy side, but it always played it too safe. Everything gets a spotlight, so you’re not ever really left wondering what happened for very long, and the tone of the film fails to match the sinister edge that it hints at the potential of. If director John Cameron Mitchell had leaned harder into the darker side of the story, this could have excelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the film is charming. Each character is likable and engaging, and the moment to moment dialog is fun and effective. there are even a few lines that feel pretty profound, though they are often poorly set-up by the shallow characterization. &lt;em&gt;How to Talk to Girls at Parties&lt;/em&gt; is both sweet and fun enough that anyone out there looking for that bridge between science fiction and punk rock will remember this for years as a solid and enjoyable flick. Nothing is really broken here, it’s just sad that if you already know what you’re craving that you’ll walk out wanting more… something more substantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other place where the film shines a bit is the music, which is fun and refreshing. I have to say, though, that it wasn’t very memorable. Very little of the music left the theater with me. I really have to hold this against the film, too, because I think this is a core expectation for this film. It’s literally about punk and how it represents human ideals of individuality, so it needs to capture that with music that gets in your head. And… it just doesn’t do it. Not enough, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Talk to Girls at Parties&lt;/em&gt; is a fun flick that’s good enough to entertain. It’s not surrounded by competition, and if you’re into this sort of quirky, fun, or unusual science fiction you’re not going to be getting it from anywhere else. Definitely watch it, it’s the only way you’ll have a chance of getting more, even if it leaves you craving a main course that never comes.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/06/2018-06-01-things-we-were-wrong-about-in-2017.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;I hate to admit it, but I often do form an impression of a film before I even see it because I am not a cold and unfeeling robot. Often the cast, director, and trailer communicate a lot about a film and what direction it may take and what it will look like when we see it. It’s also really fun to speculate about the results that we’ll get. Sometimes it’s pretty easy to forecast whether a movie will be good, but sometimes we get things wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these are movies where we were wrong about our predictions and others are ones where we felt that the popular opinion is so far out of balance with our own assessment of a movie that we know that a minority of people would find our review helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I’d like to take the time to own up to the things I was wrong about in 2017:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;10-dunkirk&quot;&gt;10. &lt;em&gt;Dunkirk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the director as well as the actors working on &lt;em&gt;Dunkirk&lt;/em&gt; it was always safe to say that it would be pretty good. Where we were wrong was about how good this film could be. After years of World War II movies that were far more interested in aspects such as the spectacle or the performances of a few actors, it felt like &lt;em&gt;Dunkirk&lt;/em&gt; was likely to be a traditional wartime drama. Christopher Nolan blew away every expectation when he delivered an experience that dissolves the border between the film and the audience while keeping your heart pumping the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;9-valerian-and-the-city-of-a-thousand-planets&quot;&gt;9. &lt;em&gt;Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may be impossible to predict when lightning will strike twice, you can make some fairly safe predictions when the environmental conditions are right. The graphic novels and comics built around the adventures of Valerian were the inspiration for Luc Besson’s &lt;em&gt;The Fifth Element&lt;/em&gt;, an all-time favorite action/adventure sci-fi film. Luc Besson returned last year with the rights to directly translate the original Valerian property into its own film with a playful and creative visual direction. Unfortunately, the final product was poorly paced and built around a plot that undermined the core themes of the setting, all of which were delivered with sub-par performances from the lead actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-the-darkest-hour&quot;&gt;8. &lt;em&gt;The Darkest Hour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes disappoint may be subtle. It was hard not to be excited about seeing Gary Oldman vanish into the role of Winston Churchill, and while &lt;em&gt;The Darkest Hour&lt;/em&gt; delivered on this promise, it failed to build a compelling narrative around it. Slowed down with exposition, and unable to construct a sense of suspense around the choices that Churchill was forced to make, &lt;em&gt;The Darkest Hour&lt;/em&gt; simply left us feeling meh, even if it did solidify Gary Oldman as one of the greatest actors of our time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-the-dark-tower&quot;&gt;7. &lt;em&gt;The Dark Tower&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;The Dark Tower&lt;/em&gt; it feels like we were wrong twice over. First off, it didn’t seem possible to make a coherent film out of such an unusual property. &lt;em&gt;The Gunslinger&lt;/em&gt; is a strange and otherworldly journey that follows a sense of dream logic and builds a unique mythology from the entire fictional world of the works of Stephen King. This was a daunting task that didn’t feel possible, and somehow what we got was a coherent and reasonably fun action flick with a little bit of that otherworldly flavor. We also were wrong in liking this one, apparently. &lt;em&gt;The Dark Tower&lt;/em&gt; was famously panned by critics with a 16% on Rotten Tomatoes, making our outlet an outlier of the popular consensus for this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-downsizing&quot;&gt;6. &lt;em&gt;Downsizing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t publish our review on &lt;em&gt;Downsizing&lt;/em&gt;, but we thought it was a quirky and thought-provoking science fiction. Ultimately, it looks like we’re the outliers on this one as &lt;em&gt;Downsizing&lt;/em&gt; sits at a Rotten Tomatoes score of 51% with few defenders championing its virtue. We stand by how we feel about the movie, but it’s impossible to dismiss that audiences found the plot lacking and the romantic interest alienating and uncomfortable with little solace to be found in the downplayed effects of a miniaturized world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-get-out&quot;&gt;5. &lt;em&gt;Get Out&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t watch this one till 2018. It slipped under the radar, and no one writing for this outlet watched it throughout all of 2017 and even though we suspected and expected it to be really good, and it is, we were just flat out wrong to have not watched it till almost a year after it came out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-the-hitmans-bodyguard&quot;&gt;4. &lt;em&gt;The Hitman’s Bodyguard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one looked fun. It really was about as boring as you can imagine, but without being specifically bad. Not much more to say about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-coco&quot;&gt;3. &lt;em&gt;Coco&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Pixar has knocked it out of the park on everything they’ve ever done, you get kind of numb to their releases. You get to the point where you’re expecting a movie that’s fine, really good even, but it blows you away when it turns out to hit all the emotional notes to pull your heartstrings. We weren’t specifically “wrong” about this one, but all the same, it was an incredibly beautiful surprise despite low expectations (for a Pixar movie).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-baywatch&quot;&gt;2. &lt;em&gt;Baywatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 2012’s &lt;em&gt;21 Jump Street&lt;/em&gt;, we were hyped for more 90’s TV dramas to receive a comedy makeover. Unfortunately &lt;em&gt;Baywatch&lt;/em&gt; was convoluted and its raunch comedy feels dated for 2017, despite needing to be a self-aware mock remake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-wonder-woman&quot;&gt;1. &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing feels better than finding out that a movie you were dreading the arrival of turned out to be one of the best movies in the genre. That’s why &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman&lt;/em&gt; is our number one pick for movies we were wrong about. This is the best way to be wrong, and the best kind of happy surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With movies based on DC comic characters on a losing streak, &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman&lt;/em&gt; was following on the heels of &lt;em&gt;Man of Steel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Batman V Superman&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt; with every indication that it would suffer from the same massive structural and thematic problems of its predecessors. However, director Patty Jenkins managed to put together a film that eschewed all of the problems that had been plaguing the DC extended universe (DCEU) and telling a compelling story that was built about what makes Wonder Woman so special as a character.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/04/2018-04-04-a-quiet-place.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Best known for his role as Jim on &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; (At least to me), director John Krasinski composed a beautiful experiment in tension that will leave audiences holding their breath. &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place&lt;/em&gt; starts with a pretty thin premise, otherworldly monsters have devastated the human population and left only a few desperate survivors who must live in total silence to avoid becoming prey. The world is brought to life with excellent cinematography and talented acting which is all held together by a level of directing that plays a little too safe, but with a level of competence that hints at an eager brilliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOBVg_6WYp4&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the world of &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place&lt;/em&gt; fails to hold up to basic scrutiny, full of implausible monsters that act as an outright silly and contrived plot device to force the characters to live in total silence, John Krasinski allows us to suspend our disbelief by avoiding even a second of film time that explains their existence or the fall of the world. By sucking us immediately into the lives of the protagonists, John Krasinski is able to have the audience buy into the silence by completely immersing us in careful character building delivered through emotional performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the wonderful acting talent on display, Emily Blunt aces every scene she is in. Her performance ends up being the backbone of the film, though John Krasinski holds his own when acting alongside her. Similar to his directing style, though, his performance feels by the numbers. He delivers when it counts, helping you to be invested in his character, but when compared to the talent of Emily Blunt, he clearly has room to grow. That said, I absolutely believe he can and want to see him in more roles that show off his range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I absolutely held my breath through the majority of the film, I do have to say that the overall construction of the film feels a little bit like a paint by number. It’s almost utilitarian in its construction, both in the way the plot unfolds as well as in the directing of each scene on its own. This is not inherently negative, but it undermines the freshness of the source material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Krasinski gets a lot of bonus points for experimenting with a story that plays so much with sound, leaving you listening to every footstep, every breath of air, every snap of a twig, or the fall of a dropped flashlight… it’s a brave and experimental choice that pays off in spades. The whole theater was silent with anticipation. If anything, it’s the creativity of the basic premise of the film that highlights the blandness of the execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not bad, but the stiffness of the cuts, character arrangement, and angles is palpable. That said, I want to see more from Krasinski as a director. I want to see if this is something he can grow beyond. However, even if he doesn’t he has a sense of taste in subject matter that may negate completely the lack of style in his craftsmanship, similar to the early work of Kevin Smith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result is still some of the best tension I’ve felt in years and a refreshing sense of anticipation that lasts for almost the whole runtime. &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place&lt;/em&gt; is a must-see for fans of good horror and viewers with a fascination for quality storytelling, editing, or film construction. It’s a blast of a thrill-ride that will keep early summer audiences on the edge of their seats while holding their breath for what’s coming around the next corner in the dark. Be sure to watch this one.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/03/2018-03-14-gringo.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Some of my favorite films are the ones that start with a well-used formula for a template and then build on it by deviating in interesting ways. &lt;em&gt;Gringo&lt;/em&gt; is absolutely one of these movies, and it is a delight to watch; though, it doesn’t quite subvert expectations enough to completely make up for having a predictable plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gringo&lt;/em&gt; follows the events surrounding its protagonist, Harold (David Oyelowo), as his life crumbles around him because of the spiral of plots that exists around him and without his knowledge. While on a routine trip to Mexico for the medicinal marijuana pill producing pharmaceutical company that he works for, everything suddenly blows up in his life all at once. As the constant victim of predatory bosses, played by Charlize Theron and Joel Edgerton, an unhinged mercenary played by Sharlto Copley, and drug cartels, Harold strives to make sense of a world that is far beyond him and happily takes advantage of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While its strengths lay in the edges of the plot, &lt;em&gt;Gringo&lt;/em&gt;’s cast excels. It’s a treat to see such an excellent cast together, each cast member playing to their strengths with all of them building each other up.  The direction and editing also really highlight their performances, and they are all fully deserving of a great deal of credit here. Thanks to the clever editing, &lt;em&gt;Gringo&lt;/em&gt; manages to build suspense with a few subtle gags that end up working over the course of the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really stands out above everything else, though, is the way &lt;em&gt;Gringo&lt;/em&gt; talks to the audience. We’re along for the ride with Harold, but we see everything happening around him and falling down on top of him, so we feel for him. And every time we’re confronted with a character who is taking advantage of him, they confront him with pithy anecdotes in a way that is overt and deliberate. They sit him down and they tell him why they are taking advantage of him, and you can see how they’ve become a villain by reducing their worldview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the plot points being fairly predictable, &lt;em&gt;Gringo&lt;/em&gt; still managed to dig into me just a little bit with every scene and leave me with something small to think about. Between all of its strengths, the astounding cast, the clever editing, and the provocative ways it plays with its plot, &lt;em&gt;Gringo&lt;/em&gt; largely manages to overcome and work within the bounds of the predictable nature of its story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, that’s where I fall on this one: it’s a fantastic demonstration of craft that has some fascinating ideas inside of it. &lt;em&gt;Gringo&lt;/em&gt; is an excellent work of creative satire that is easy to recommend and is absolutely worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/03/2018-03-08-the-strangers-prey-at-night.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Strangers Pray at Night&lt;/em&gt; is the worst religious film I have ever seen. In all seriousness, though, &lt;em&gt;The Strangers: Prey at Night&lt;/em&gt; is probably going to be a bit of a divisive film, with more viewers leaning on the side of disliking it strongly. One of the challenges of discussing a merit of the film is giving weight to each element. On some level, you judge the whole. Since this is a largely subjective exercise, breaking a movie down into its parts helps you strive for a more objective understanding of it. &lt;em&gt;Prey at Night&lt;/em&gt; contains picturesque views that are meticulously constructed with excellent cinematography, and the pacing is technically sound due to technical competency from the cast and crew; however, it’s undermined by an unoriginal and thoughtless plot that has more groans than scares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/91-Z20uttEk&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, &lt;em&gt;Prey at Night&lt;/em&gt; does nothing more than delight in meanness and terror. While there are a few shots that are constructed around building tension from the unknown, the vast majority of the effect is from watching the terror of the main characters front and center or from enjoying the calculated superiority of the unstoppable killers. Even these things are hard to take pleasure in, though, given the terrible and thoughtless behavior of the protagonists and the power of the antagonists to teleport just about wherever they need to be. You’re never given a reason to be invested in the family, except from a pure survival standpoint, and the killers are pure terror anarchists who act with no reason or motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably this could be the point, but &lt;em&gt;The Strangers&lt;/em&gt; never digs into what it means to have villains with no purpose or reason. Other movies have done that better and had more fun with it. You’d be better off re-watching &lt;em&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;/em&gt;.  Additionally, having dumb protagonists distracts from any ideas that might be inferred from the plot. In fact, it’s just outright horrendous watching the lead actors, whose characters I cannot remember the names of, stumble through the story. There were moments where the entire theater that I watched the movie with was yelling at the screen, and that is something truly special. This may be a selling point to some… watching dumb characters get terrified and murdered, but it’s not my cup of tea. It just feels poisonous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all of this, there are some definite bright spots. The cinematography is astounding. The shots of the trailer park at night, filled with little bitty bits of style, really grab your attention. &lt;em&gt;Prey at Night&lt;/em&gt; is easily at it’s brightest during the moments where it’s quiet, and it allows you to soak in the isolation of the environment. Director Johannes Roberts builds on the excellent framing and imagery by constructing reasonable tension in the pacing of the film. It’s really sad that this is the only tension that &lt;em&gt;Strangers&lt;/em&gt; has to offer, given that good pacing can really push a decent film into greatness. Given the emptiness of the plot, any tension at all that the audience feels comes solely from competent construction, and so it’s just sad to see that talent wasted here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a final note, I also wanted to say that the musical selection was savory. The use of classics to add a chill in the air is brilliantly done, however, there just isn’t enough of it to make up for the rest of the movie. And that’s sort of what &lt;em&gt;The Strangers: Prey at Night&lt;/em&gt; is in a nutshell, a hollow and empty film dressed up beautifully in well-made trappings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you care more about how the movie looks than what it has to say, or if you really delight in watching the mean-spirited pleasure of people being stalked and killed without purpose, &lt;em&gt;The Strangers: Prey at Night&lt;/em&gt; may be for you. For me, though, this is just evidence that it’s near impossible to deliver substance purely through the art and sound design. For everyone else, give this one a pass.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/02/2018-02-24-game-night.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game Night&lt;/em&gt; is one of those films that picks a theme and uses that theme to unify every aspect of its construction. &lt;em&gt;Game Night&lt;/em&gt; imbues its editing, plot, dialog, and character performances with the levity that comes from playing games competitively with friends. With very few real flaw, it shines as one of the better movies of the year, which is unique for this style of comedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fNtLIcyjsnI&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really appreciate when a filmmaker delights in the entire craft of their work. Directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein clearly took immense joy in structuring &lt;em&gt;Game Night&lt;/em&gt; from top to bottom with a sense of playfulness that is appropriate to the story just as writer Mark Perez plays with the audience with a winding narrative that works because of the levity it uses in approaching the plot. Where the pure joy of directing shows most here is the transition shots. All of the transition shots in &lt;em&gt;Game Night&lt;/em&gt; are zoomed out, and either make real-world cars and actors look and feel like board game pieces or they use plastic board game pieces and toy cars in a way that makes them look as though they are real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a clever trick, and a beautiful use of both directing and editing to play with the subject matter. In addition to the craft exercised in the writing and directing, all of the actors put out performances that entertain and delight. The absolute standout here is Jesse Plemons (Meth Damon) as Gary.  Jesse Plemons steals every scene he is in, and I was left constantly wanting to see more of Gary. Outside of Jesse Plemons, Rachel McAdams and Jason Bateman have a great deal of chemistry that, combined with their talent and skill as performers, adds to the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond all of these positive aspects, &lt;em&gt;Game Night&lt;/em&gt; also delves into how we compete with the people around us. I found the questions about how we define our role models by defining what we want out of life can affect our ability to be happy. Though this was there, it was in the background, and I do feel it could possibly have been built a little more tightly into the metaphors of the story.  As a follow up to this, there is definitely a feeling of disconnected events that carries &lt;em&gt;Game Night&lt;/em&gt; through its last 15 minutes that fails to organically close out the narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the plot meanders a bit, the tone of the film keeps it from being too distracting. The whole film feels playful, and this fits with that, but there was definitely room for more focus in the direction as &lt;em&gt;Game Night&lt;/em&gt; starts tying together its story. This is also one of those areas where your mileage may vary and how funny you find the humor to be will definitely determine how important this is to you as a viewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final nitpick against &lt;em&gt;Game Night&lt;/em&gt;, I have to say that the music was not particularly memorable. It was enjoyable, and it wasn’t ever distracting, but it rarely felt like it really moved the story forward or tied a scene together. I’d like to have seen the same level of joy for composition in the music as there is in the directing, writing, and acting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, &lt;em&gt;Game Night&lt;/em&gt; is an excellent movie. Its meticulous construction and passionate delivery of its story in ways that feel consistently playful make &lt;em&gt;Game Night&lt;/em&gt; something special that will be worth remembering as one of the better films of its type ever made. If you’re into smart and light comedy, definitely give this one a watch.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/02/2018-02-23-annihilation.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Before saying anything else about &lt;em&gt;Annihilation&lt;/em&gt;, I want to say this first: &lt;em&gt;Annihilation&lt;/em&gt; is like a beautiful waking nightmare of intense flowering macabre that could be described as a Frieda painting sprouting forth from a Monet. There are a lot of flaws with this film, but what it does well, it does so well that there are no supplements or substitutions to be found elsewhere and my criticisms may even be over harsh. I am my harshest when I want better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/89OP78l9oF0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the dreamlike nature of &lt;em&gt;Annihilation&lt;/em&gt;, if the above is all you need to know then I would recommend going and watching the film before reading further. With that said, &lt;em&gt;Annihilation&lt;/em&gt;’s greatest strength is the intense focus and control that director Alex Garland exercises over every single frame. In addition to a meticulous eye for composition, Garland excels here by exercising a rarely seen skill for manipulating the color throughout. Each image is carefully composed and balanced, which sometimes can be lost given the organic nature of the locations we’re exposed to as an audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this bed of astounding cinematography, Alex Garland grows a garden of dreamlike images. Both beautiful and horrifying, the pictures that Alex Garland paints are deeply provocative. Be warned, though, that Garland delves into the grotesque. The darkest and goriest scenes in &lt;em&gt;Annihilation&lt;/em&gt; stand out as frightening and horrifying to watch but are viewed so clinically that they are more upsetting than frightening. They are impactful, but in the same way, a dream that doesn’t wake you up may be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detached half-wakeful way that &lt;em&gt;Annihilation&lt;/em&gt; drifts from scene to scene bridges is both a strength and weakness. The best films that have followed dream logic through their narrative start off grounded and end someplace meaningful, such as &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;. Unfortunately, there is no bridge between the believable and unbelievable here. From the beginning, &lt;em&gt;Annihilation&lt;/em&gt; feels loose and ethereal in how it deals with the details of its world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get into this, I do need to go over the core premise of the film, though all of this information could be gathered from the trailer or from the back of the first book. Lena (Natalie Portman) has been missing her husband for over a year, when suddenly he returns. Without telling her anything about where he has been or what he’s done in his absence, he falls seriously ill. A team of shadowy government military agents takes Lena captive and tells her that for the past several years a “shimmer” has been growing outward from a lighthouse on the nearby coast, that nothing and no one that has gone inside it has ever returned… except Lena’s husband.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right from the beginning, though, everything feels so loose and shallow. The shimmer itself is just vaguely defined and described, and we never get a sense of basic attempts to simply go into the shimmer and immediately come out of it. The government institution and all of the characters surrounding Lena are poorly developed, and even Lena herself never gets a last name. This is the part of the film where we need to feel grounded and get a sense of normality and a solid feel for what we think we’re about to experience so that when everything changes it feels like falling into sleep. Unfortunately, because it never feels solid, it’s jarring right from the start and it continues through to the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More tragically, the end fails to feel connected to the story in any meaningful way. It’s not an over cerebral ending, just the opposite, it’s incredibly mundane, but at the same time failing to explain anything or impart any kind of meaning to the experience that leads up to it. It’s the worst sort of ending that tries to upend the story in a way that the narrative hasn’t earned the right to do. The close is easily the worst part of the entire film and it had me reeling with disappointment as I walked out of the theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all of these negatives, &lt;em&gt;Annihilation&lt;/em&gt; does something that few horror movies do, and that is to capture the beauty in a nightmare that feels as though it cannot be escaped or woken from. When it accomplishes this at its best, &lt;em&gt;Annihilation&lt;/em&gt; delivers something that doesn’t exist anywhere else with this degree of quality. I just wish it had done more than that, because it feels like it easily could have.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/02/2018-02-16-black-panther.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;It shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone that &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; is an excellent film that does a great job at growing the Marvel universe while at the same time delighting audiences with thrilling action.  A lot of people are calling this the best film in the Marvel cinematic universe (MCU), however, while there is a lot of merit to this point of view, &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; has some important flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I want to start by discussing all of the things that &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; does better than any other film in the genre. From the beginning, it introduces fantastical science-fiction elements on Earth in ways that evolve the MCU. While both &lt;em&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; explored parts of the universe with spacecraft and aliens, &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; brings those elements to Earth, and then it promises to let them bleed out into all the other movies. The fictional country of Wakanda is referred to literally as the city of gold and represents an almost Atlantian society of super advanced technology and it is just exciting to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could see a hundred different stories set in Wakanda, it is just such a beautiful and atmospheric setting. In addition to this, &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; is a technical advancement as we see large-scale choreographed combat normally reserved for &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; movies. Graphically, it feels more grounded and less cartoony than &lt;em&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;, but it embraces a beautiful sense of foreign culture. The way that &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; borrows much of its visual style from African culture, as well as its musical themes, adds something special. We also get to spend some time in South Korea, and we get a few moments in the UK, however, they aren’t really enough to expand the palette of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads to the representation &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; offers to an underserved audience. It’s undeniable that this is important, especially to children, and there is a massive gaping hole in the superhero genre’s representation of people of color. I’m not going to make the bold statement that &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; is the first of anything, I mean, we have had &lt;em&gt;Blade&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Men in Black&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Hancock&lt;/em&gt;; however, these heroes are few and far between. I wholeheartedly feel that this is a great step forward, and that we need to see much more represenation in our action adventure films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of those elements are the most important part of a movie to you, then it makes absolute sense for you to feel that &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; is the best movie we have gotten. And it is absolutely fair that on all of those levels, this movie is firing on all cylinders. There’s another element that I think will frequently be cited as a major plus, and that is the villain: Erik Killmonger played by Michael B. Jordan. Jordan’s portrayal of Killmonger makes him sympathetic while also terrifying in his ferocity. He is like the Joker in how he shines a bright spotlight on the flaws and failings of Wakanda as a whole as well as the Black Panther directly, highlighting how they have failed not just their own people, but the world at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, he is the best Marvel villain put to film. Unfortunately, he is so good at exposing the flaws in the protagonists that they almost feel unlikeable. This is exacerbated by the fact that the Black Panther never directly confronts Killmonger on a philosophical level, and by only conflicting with him physically it causes his victory to feel hollow. He uses the things he learns about Killmonger to grow, but this growth feels like it’s tangential to the very real and direct ways that he’s failed. The resolution to the conflict is just so blunt and dismissive of the flaws that lead to the problems in the world, it’s almost obtuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the last three movies in the franchise, it feels like a step backward in storytelling. &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy 2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt; all told stories that had meaningful resolutions that evolved not just their characters, but Marvel’s storytelling as a whole. Tragically, it feels like the writers of &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; felt that they were pushing so many boundaries visually and artistically, that they played it too safe with the storytelling. It’s also possible that the questions they’re asking just didn’t have good enough answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, despite all of its technical and artistic steps forward, &lt;em&gt;Black Panther&lt;/em&gt; ends up feeling like Marvel film from mid-2015. And, that’s not a bad thing, this is a fantastic movie. It’s definitely worth your time and is absolutely a must see for all fans of the genre. I just can’t call it the best movie in the MCU, but it doesn’t have to be.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/01/2018-01-26-top-ten-movies-of-2017.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Every year it’s worth reflecting on the achievements and progress that we have made together, and one of the ways we can do that is by taking a look at the art that was produced during that time. This can be an important lens for seeing how a culture grows and changes as well as for identifying technical achievement. Some years it’s hard to pick a top 10 because a few movies are so far ahead that it’s hard for the rest to measure up. 2017 was challenging because we saw such a large offering of films that broke new ground, asked important questions, entertained, and made us feel a wealth of emotions that catered to almost every type of personal taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some genres, such as action-adventure, had so many incredible entries that a reasonable list could almost have been completely filled with action flicks. When it comes to talking about the best movies to come out in a year, it’s important to note that based on personal taste, different elements of a film are worth more to different people. I want to start out by saying that we’re not going to be fair here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our top 10 of 2017, we want to look at films that tread new ground, often leaving us walking out of the theater feeling giddy and excited or thoughtful and contemplative. Some of these are flawed works and several failed on several levels delivering uneven experiences. Cinema is an exciting medium, and it’s important that this list captures what we found to be inspiring, which is why we picked some of these films over more technically excellent works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be overlooking movies we haven’t seen yet, as well. 2017 was filled with so much goodness that we missed gems such as &lt;em&gt;Get Out&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Phantom Thread&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Big Sick&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lady Bird&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Logan Lucky&lt;/em&gt;,  &lt;em&gt;Wind River&lt;/em&gt;, and “Call Me By Your Name”. We know we’ve missed out on some fantastic movies, even with everything we did watch this year. I’m sorry. They’ll be watched ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of that said, let’s begin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;10-happy-death-day&quot;&gt;10). &lt;em&gt;Happy Death Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2018/01/happy-death-day-screen.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Happy Death Day&quot; title=&quot;Happy Death Day&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quirky and strange, &lt;em&gt;Happy Death Day&lt;/em&gt; is the suspense-thriller-comedy spiritual successor to &lt;em&gt;Groundhog Day&lt;/em&gt; that we never knew we wanted. Bringing together a range of creepy, funny, and outright weird storytelling elements, &lt;em&gt;Happy Death Day&lt;/em&gt; is a movie that is almost impossible to forget. While lacking musically and failing to deliver tones that work for all of its themes, &lt;em&gt;Happy Death Day&lt;/em&gt; makes our list because of the wide number of genres we wanted to represent as well as the unrestrained joy it brings into its storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;9-three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri&quot;&gt;9). &lt;em&gt;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2018/01/three-billboards-banner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri&quot; title=&quot;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gem stood out because of its sharp writing that was well delivered by an outstanding cast. Despite several pacing problems and often using scathingly witty dialog at the expense of the emotional core of its story, &lt;em&gt;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&lt;/em&gt; has the most thought-provoking ending of the year. It’s impossible to walk away from this experience without questioning what it is saying about its own story and challenging its viewers to think harder and talk more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-alien-covenant&quot;&gt;8). &lt;em&gt;Alien: Covenant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2018/01/alien-covenant-banner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Alien Covenant&quot; title=&quot;Alien Covenant&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ridley Scott returns to the darker horror roots of the Alien franchise as he dives deeper into the more horrific extension of &lt;em&gt;Prometheus&lt;/em&gt;.  By turning more toward the type of suspense from the original &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; and returning to the classic version of the monster that series is known for, &lt;em&gt;Alien: Covenant&lt;/em&gt; manages to be one of the most discussed as well as also one of the most interesting horror movies of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7-baby-driver&quot;&gt;7). &lt;em&gt;Baby Driver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2018/01/baby-driver-banner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Baby Driver&quot; title=&quot;Baby Driver&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director Edgar Wright moved on from thoughtful parody to pure action with 2017’s  &lt;em&gt;Baby Driver&lt;/em&gt; one of the most detailed action flicks in years, and a near perfect thrill ride charged with music that gets your blood moving. &lt;em&gt;Baby Driver&lt;/em&gt; is ahead of the crowd, and was so good that even with all of the amazing films this year it was an easy pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6-the-last-jedi&quot;&gt;6). &lt;em&gt;The Last Jedi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2018/01/last-jedi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Last Jedi&quot; title=&quot;Last Jedi&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; franchise has struggled with moving forward or saying anything interesting since the end of the original trilogy. There have been glimpses of goodness here and there, but &lt;em&gt;The Last Jedi&lt;/em&gt; is a deeply controversial film that finds something new to say, seems to reflect both on its own nature as well as the nature of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; as a whole as a Disney property. It manages to do all of this while being immensely entertaining. It’s not perfect, and its detractors have some valid criticisms of the film, but at the same time, it is constantly encouraging discussion about what the purpose of the franchise is, what it means, and where it can go from here. Easily the first film in the series to be worthy of the original trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-thor-ragnarok&quot;&gt;5). &lt;em&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2018/01/thor-ragnarok-banner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Thor Ragnarok&quot; title=&quot;Thor Ragnarok&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marvel has steadily departed from its original formula over the course of the last year with &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy 2&lt;/em&gt;, moving away from pure action movies to find some of the most emotional space it’s ever occupied. However, despite all the other movies with Marvel characters this year, &lt;em&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt; stands out with its tight construction, bright sense of humor, and the most intelligent themes in any Marvel movie. &lt;em&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt; is easily the height of the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far, and hopefully an indication of where we’ll be going in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-blade-runner-2049&quot;&gt;4). &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2018/01/blade-runner-2049-banner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; title=&quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never dared hope that anyone would make a sequel to &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; that is this true to the slow burn of the original. &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt; is an artistic work that dives in 30 years after the original and runs wild with the story implied by the director’s cut of its predecessor. &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt; is an absolute must-see for fans of the original and we may not see anything else like it for a long long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-coco&quot;&gt;3). &lt;em&gt;Coco&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2017/11/coco-cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Coco&quot; title=&quot;Coco&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pixar doesn’t have the perfect record with me that they used to, but &lt;em&gt;Coco&lt;/em&gt; showed that they are still capable of evolving. &lt;em&gt;Coco&lt;/em&gt; is packed with incredible imagery that captures the beauty of a culture as well as a story that lands on multiple levels. In addition to all of that, &lt;em&gt;Coco&lt;/em&gt; managed to bring out happy tears from me, which is something I have almost never experienced during a film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-the-shape-of-water&quot;&gt;2). &lt;em&gt;The Shape of Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2017/12/the-shape-of-water-cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shape of Water&quot; title=&quot;Shape of Water&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme of this year’s top ten is movies that made me feel the magic all over again. &lt;em&gt;The Shape of Water&lt;/em&gt; takes the monster movie formula from the golden age of cinema and puts an outlandish twist on it. Think King Kong, but where the girl kidnaps the ape. Director Guillermo del Toro has captured something truly outlandish that is pure joy and entertainment to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;honorable-mentions&quot;&gt;Honorable Mentions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to take a moment to mention movies that would likely have made this list in most other years. &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman&lt;/em&gt; as the very best DC movie in years and for finally delivering an outstanding female superhero, &lt;em&gt;Logan&lt;/em&gt; for delivering the Wolverine movie that fans have been craving for over a decade, &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; for addressing a world with the press at war with the American government at a time when it was propagating lies that were costing human lives, &lt;em&gt;IT&lt;/em&gt; for capturing the fun of &lt;em&gt;Goonies&lt;/em&gt; in a creepy film aimed at adults, &lt;em&gt;Lego Batman&lt;/em&gt; for making me laugh so hard that my sides physically hurt within its first ten minutes, and &lt;em&gt;Wonder&lt;/em&gt; for showing the whole beautiful range of human emotion and challenging far more what it means to be normal than what it means to be different. Each and every one of these is worth your time and should be watched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-dunkirk&quot;&gt;1). &lt;em&gt;Dunkirk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:small;text-align:center;margin:10px 0px 15px 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;padding: 0px 0px 2px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/2017/07/dunkirk-cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dunkirk&quot; title=&quot;Dunkirk&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping with our theme of films that remind us of what makes movies so special, &lt;em&gt;Dunkirk&lt;/em&gt; is one of the few films ever made that I cannot even imagine outside of a theater experience. It felt like my heart was going to stop. Every element of this work of art went to driving an intensity of emotion and raw tension that is unparalleled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s our list for 2017! Be sure to tell us what you think in the comments below and let us know if you agree or disagree, and let us know what other movies you may have picked instead.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2018/01/2018-01-23-maze-runner-the-death-cure.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;When reviewing an entry into a franchise of films, I feel it is important to discuss how I felt about the previous films. This important because it establishes a baseline so that you can decide if we have similar feelings about the franchise as a whole and provide context for the current review. To that end, I think it’s important that I establish that I have not watched previous entries into the Maze Runner franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an outside perspective, &lt;em&gt;Maze Runner: The Death Cure&lt;/em&gt; is an average action flick that doesn’t deliver particularly well on any level. I don’t really feel like it’s fair to say that it’s bad, but it isn’t particularly good. The core flaw with &lt;em&gt;The Death Cure&lt;/em&gt; is a lack of attention to detail that undermines the setting, story, and action sequences that are otherwise engaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world where an infection that is functionally a zombie virus has infected most of the planet, &lt;em&gt;The Death Cure&lt;/em&gt; centers around the tension of what it refers to as the last human city and the surrounding slums. The last city is strange in how it is extremely well established for the last holdout of human civilization. Its walls are supposedly what has kept the infection at bay, but at the same time, the method of infection never feels entirely clear. The slums outside the city feel way too expansive given that they are pinched between an infected world and a city that is willing to pummel them with missiles. Finally, the walls themselves feel poorly considered as the main characters move in and out of the city freely once they arrive at it, despite the narrative insisting that it is all but impossible to cross between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cumulatively, this results in a general narrative dissonance built right into the setting, where you can feel the type of universe and setting that the writers wanted, but weren’t quite capable of delivering. It rarely breaks the story on a thematic level, so this issue largely just feels like background noise. Unfortunately, the same sort of attention to detail bleeds through into the main story, and also the action scenes. The whole thing ends up feeling mostly contrived and prevented me from enjoying the main conflicts as much as I think I could have if the structure had had a stronger foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the film’s credit, I never felt lost for not having seen its predecessors. It did a good job of catching me up to speed on the universe and setting, and by about a quarter of the way in I had a firm grasp of what was happening, the dangers of the world, and even the backstory of the main characters. Just as importantly, I feel like I gathered most of this information by seeing it instead of through heavy-handed dialog, which is a plus. There were some reveals in the story that lacked impact without the context of the previous movies; however, I can’t properly discuss them without spoilers. What I can say is that it is highly likely that an invested viewer, who has followed the series up till now, will get a few things that didn’t land as intended for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before wrapping up, I want to go over some of what worked for me. It’s important to express that the core ideas for the story and world resonated with me. This compensates a lot for the things that are lacking because I wanted to like the story.  Additionally, I gathered a fair amount of entertainment from the pure spectacle. Director Wes Ball competently delivers on the scale of a world falling apart despite being unable to imbue it with more than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maze Runner: The Death Cure&lt;/em&gt; is a flawed film that doesn’t work particularly well. While it might gain some extra impact in the larger context of the story, it suffers from some core problems with its construction. The result isn’t bad enough to be unenjoyable, and it delivers on some ideas that there is definitely an audience for. If you’re jonesing for some post-apocalyptic fun, and you can enjoy some cheap action without thinking about it, this is worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/12/2017-12-23-mollys-game.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molly’s Game&lt;/em&gt; slunk under the radar this Christmas season as the first film directed by Aaron Sorkin. While I am not experienced with work he contributed to previously as a writer ( Social Network and Moneyball to name two ), his directing holds great promise for future films. This theatrical adaptation summarizes the memoir written by Molly Bloom, a strong skier on her way to the Olympics who’s life is suddenly shifted into high stakes poker games for the rich and the dirty alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to start by saying that I love dialog heavy films and I enjoy a quick witted battle of the minds between two characters. The writing in &lt;em&gt;Molly’s Game&lt;/em&gt; really plays to this concept, pitting the dynamic talents of Jessica Chastain as sharp business-woman, Molly Bloom, and Idris Elba, as straightforward lawyer, Charlie Jaffey. The connection between these two leads channels into an intriguing battle of right and wrong and carries the story where it drags. The result pokes gentle holes in the concept of what is considered a good role-model or simply what defines a good person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;em&gt;Molly’s Game&lt;/em&gt; suffers from subtle pain points such as weak pacing and lack of music. Aaron Sorkin uses a traditional plot structure that starts in the present and then transitions back and forth in time to intertwine important events in Molly Bloom’s life. This structure is solid, but the timehops undermine the pacing. While the viewer is begging for more backstory, they are left gasping for air from the complicated and uneventful dialog of the present. The flashback poker scenes are thrilling, showing off the full spectrum of emotions experienced in poker, accented by some fantastic comedic one liners. Moments in the present express the stifling air of Molly’s current situation, but supportive music would have served these heavy scenes where there tend to be strange gaps in dialog, breaking the pacing and the viewer’s train of thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a film does so many basic components well, it’s easy to poke holes in its few flaws. Being able to centralize all of my criticisms into just a lack of music and pacing proves how much &lt;em&gt;Molly’s Game&lt;/em&gt; did right. It’s a film set on taking you through Molly’s story and exploring her motivations. When a story is heavily dialog focused, the pacing has to be tight and concise, otherwise you will lose your viewer. My reason for the lower rating is the end of the film didn’t have the emotional weight I needed it to have. It wasn’t supported enough by the events in the story and if the sections had been rearranged and more tightly connected, it would have been such a powerful moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your sights are set at the theater this winter season, this film is intriguing and worth the view. Especially if you actually know how to play poker and need to escape family for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/12/2017-12-19-the-post.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;While watching &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt;, it occurred to me that the Vietnam era struggle of the press against the government to reveal fundamental truths about the conflict is to journalists as World War II is to most all Americans. It represents a time when the disruption of the government was purely virtuous, requiring good people to risk their life and liberty by standing up against a force that was unambiguously wrong. When you go through a conflict like that and achieve such a hard-won victory, it’s hard not to want to relive that glory. How can a journalist not long to feel that sense of urgency to their work on some level?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; manages to capture the feeling of this conflict of attack on our inalienable rights by the very institutions that were meant to protect them. It’s primarily the showcase of an excellent cast, composed of Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, and Bob Odenkirk, which makes this work. There is even a grounded performance from David Cross that feels right at home in this dramatic setting. Everything else the movie has: the writing, the directing, the music… all of it is propped up on an ensemble of incredible acting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That isn’t at all to say that those elements are sub-par, far from it, in fact. It’s just that everything else is caught up in the way that Tom Hanks plays an impotent lion of a man (Ben Bradlee, executive editor of &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;), who has a terrible roar but ultimately risks nothing. More importantly than that is the timidity that Meryl Streep imbues into Kay Graham (owner of &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;) who quietly puts everything on the line for what she believes is important. The contrast in these performances startled me even as they asked what true bravery is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this does cause the film to feel unbalanced. The music never feels inspired, and the narrative struggles from needing to teach the audience the political history of Nixon and the Vietnam war at the same time as it is trying to tell a story. The plot frequently inserts heavy-handed speeches and conversations that feel engineered to act as exposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the combined effect of these minor weaknesses is a slight flatness to the film. However, this never causes it to drag too much. The elements that work excel so much that the flaws pale in comparison. Moreover, the conflict between the press and a president who would attempt to discredit and silence them is profoundly relevant again. I walked out of the theater struck by the importance of protecting our first amendment rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; and found it both entertaining and thought-provoking. Between the importance of the story and the out of this world performances in its delivery, &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt; is one of the easiest movies to recommend this year.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/12/2017-12-12-the-shape-of-water.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;There’s something special about a film that can still make you feel a pure sense of radiant joy. I have to admit that I was so captivated by &lt;em&gt;The Shape of Water&lt;/em&gt; that it was hard to see it as anything but beautiful. The setting is filled with inviting warmth, while the actors melt so deeply into their characters that the distinction is lost between the two, and the music… the music felt like going home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director Guillermo del Toro has a special talent for crafting a narrative that reminds me of a half-remembered fairy tale while remaining wholly unique and fresh. It’s an ability that he brings to mastery here. Definitely a story for adults, &lt;em&gt;The Shape of Water&lt;/em&gt; tries to touch that part of you that feels like you are always alone so that it can be reminded what it feels like to be warm and comforted for a few moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn’t a single element that holds the whole movie together. Each piece contributes to a concert of ideas, images, and melodies. I do believe that special recognition is deserved for the performance of Sally Hawkins as Eliza Esposito, the silent protagonist who must portray so much with so little. However, she is surrounded by fantastic complimenting performers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am particularly struck by the beauty of the words. I can take just the ones from the trailer, “he does not know how I am incomplete.” We are all incomplete, and it is why it is so painful to see those who wear their incompleteness on the outside. It is uncomfortable to see them so bravely endure what we work so hard to hide. The writing weaves these beautiful ideas together among these touching characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of it is smoothed over with a careful coat of glowing music from the past. A tableau of sound that draws from you a portrait of emotion blankets every passing moment as we slip in and out of Guillermo del Toro’s reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very few defects were pronounced enough to grab my attention during the viewing. There is some awkward exposition, some forced dialog to give voice to Eliza’s feelings, and I’m not sure the climax quite fits. And, viewer beware, the movie gets graphically weird with its sexual subject matter. However, none of that kept me from a sense of raw escapism that I don’t often get to experience. By the end of the film, I was absolutely giddy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Shape of Water&lt;/em&gt; is a fun ride even as it is a warm romance, walking the line between each carefully. I’ll remember this one for years to come and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something weird, but special.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/12/2017-12-05-we-need-to-talk-about-cupids-dagger.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t been watching &lt;em&gt;The Orville&lt;/em&gt;, or if you’re not the type to keep track of episode titles, you may not be familiar with &lt;em&gt;Cupid’s Dagger&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Orville&lt;/em&gt; is a series that has proven quite divisive among audiences. Despite a rocky start, &lt;em&gt;The Orville&lt;/em&gt; quickly began thoughtfully tackling &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/2017/09/25/finding-balance-with-the-orville/&quot;&gt;complicated issues&lt;/a&gt; with nuanced sensitivity. As of now, the vast majority of the aired episodes stand out as challenging science fiction that elevates the series to that rare class of parody that doesn’t just mock its genre but truly aspires to the best of what it can produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, we desperately need to talk critically about episode 9 of the first season, titled &lt;em&gt;Cupid’s Dagger&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Spoiler Warning: I’m about to tell you everything that happens in &lt;em&gt;Cupid’s Dagger&lt;/em&gt;. I don’t necessarily recommend watching it before reading on, just… be aware. I’m throwing it all out here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Cupid’s Dagger&lt;/em&gt;, the crew of the Orville is sent on a mission of peace to help negotiate the future of two species in conflict over a world they each claim as their origin. Each of the two species has sent an ambassador to negotiate aboard the Orville as Darulio (played by Rob Lowe), a third party archeologist, analyzes an ancient artifact from the planet to identify which race truly lived on the planet first. While Darulio performs his investigation, Cmdr. Kelly Grayson (played by Adrianne Palicki) approaches him for a sexual encounter. Shortly thereafter, the captain of the Orville (played by Seth Macfarlane) also becomes infatuated with Darulio and also has a sexual encounter with the archeologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These serial romantic encounters play off of the larger context of the characters involved in a way that is not pertinent to this story, and so I’m going to gloss over the character drama caused by them. The main effect is that the crew is distracted, and fails to properly maintain diplomacy between the visiting ambassadors. This negligence results in the assembling of the respective fleets of each species around the disputed planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where things get sticky. What comes next is why we have to have an uncomfortable talk. We find that Darulio is a member of a species that regularly secretes a hormone that chemically compels those in contact with it into sexual relationships with those around them. The crew of the ship then uses the chemical on the visiting ambassadors to deliberately compel them into a sexual relationship in order to manipulate them into ceasing hostilities long enough to provide the results initially promised by the archeological component of the negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you may be savvy enough to have picked up on what happened there: the protagonists deliberately used chemicals to manipulate people into engaging sexually. This is rape, and it is never addressed by the plot. In a show that has previously shown great consideration of its subject matter, the unexamined use of rape to resolve the core conflict displays a disgusting lack of social awareness. It is a throwback to the days when protagonists could unapologetically commit horrifying atrocities. Moreover, this &lt;em&gt;unexamined&lt;/em&gt; use of &lt;em&gt;rape&lt;/em&gt; is a textbook example of &lt;strong&gt;rape culture&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to know that I am aware that this term can be overused. I have seen it used to target entire groups blindly. Entire genders have been blanketed by this term. But here and now, we have such an extreme textbook example, that we have to use these words to acknowledge what has happened. If you are not familiar with rape culture, here is the definition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rape Culture&lt;/strong&gt; is an environment in which rape is prevalent and in which sexual violence is excused and normalized in the media and popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This definition is important because it cites 3 specific criteria that define rape culture (It is uncomfortable to say, and it’s uncomfortable to read those words over and over again, but this issue is critical to our culture, and it must be emphasized and so I must be explicit about the issue we are talking about.):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The rape must be &lt;em&gt;prevalent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The rape must be &lt;em&gt;excused&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;rape&lt;/em&gt; must be &lt;em&gt;normalized&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even a show I love cannot be excused from this criticism, and so I am going to identify how &lt;em&gt;Cupid’s Dagger&lt;/em&gt; meets all 3 of these criteria definitively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it must be pointed out that the rape is the most &lt;em&gt;prevalent&lt;/em&gt; aspect &lt;em&gt;Cupid’s Dagger&lt;/em&gt;. It permeates the plot from beginning to end as multiple characters are similarly taken advantage of while their judgment is compromised chemically. Ultimately, the climax of the episode is resolved by the subversion of the free will of the ambassadors at the most critical moment in which the threat is resolved by the protagonist. This is the most definitive element of the most important scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the &lt;em&gt;rape&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;excused&lt;/em&gt; by the protagonists as the solution to their problems. Their negligence throughout the episode results in a final conflict to which they have no reasonable answer. By resolving this conflict through the subjugation of free choice, the show excuses the rape as a viable solution without ever challenging whether or not it should or should not be used. In failing to acknowledge the moral issue in chemically manipulating the judgment of a third party, &lt;em&gt;The Orville&lt;/em&gt; suggests that is an acceptable solution that needs no excuse when the need arises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in &lt;em&gt;Cupid’s Dagger&lt;/em&gt; the rape is &lt;em&gt;normalized&lt;/em&gt; by failing to ever call it by name. Rape. A harsh word that implies so much emotional torment and pain that it is agonizing to even read. By not acknowledging that what we are seeing is rape, &lt;em&gt;The Orville&lt;/em&gt; depicts these events as so normal that they are not even considered in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this episode of &lt;em&gt;The Orville&lt;/em&gt; perfectly meets the criteria required to qualify as a textbook example of rape culture in modern media. I still love this show and feel that it has displayed an abundance of sensitivity in many of its episodes. However, this does not excuse what happened here. This was a failure of perspective that escaped everyone responsible for shaping what was presented to viewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important that we talk about it, too. I know that the term is abused. It’s difficult to look at. It’s difficult to hear. Often it’s used controversially for attention. I plead with you to look past all of that and see what is truly important here. It is essential that we point it out when confronted with a textbook example of the prevalent, excused, and normalized use of rape in our media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By talking about it we label it for what it is. I cannot stress how critical this is to prevent the attitudes and ideas that allowed this to happen from spreading. I’m not asking you to avoid this show or boycott its creators, only to be a part of the conversation. If we all talk about this together in order to be aware of the media we consume, we can prevent this from becoming normal. We deserve better from creators. We deserve better from our society.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/11/2017-11-21-coco.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Pixar has always lead the way in modern animation with a library that contains some of the most beautiful and complicated works ever made. While they are continually improving their animation quality and visual style, &lt;em&gt;Coco&lt;/em&gt; shows that they are also able to evolve their storytelling in refreshing directions. The result is technically beautiful artistic accomplishment that is satisfying on a deeply emotional level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to talk about the animation first because it is the highest quality element of the film. Disney’s Pixar captures a gradient of colors as it moves from a warm portrait of life in Mexico to the imaginatively fantastical land of the dead. This is the most consistent arc in the film as the colors and locations shift with the tone of the narrative. When we first see the bright and colorful expanse of the land of the dead it is absolutely breathtaking. That beauty never quite lets up until the beauty of the story picks up where the visuals leave off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coco&lt;/em&gt;’s story goes places that other films tend to avoid, and flesh out much more human needs. The basic plot of the film follows Miguel, a young man who is still learning who he wants to be. Miguel longs to make music despite being raised by a family who ideologically opposes the very idea of song and dance. This very ideological divide drives a deep wedge between Miguel and his family, resulting in his running away from home to pursue his music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many modern children’s films would be content to explore the theme of following your dreams, but &lt;em&gt;Coco&lt;/em&gt; has much more to say about the importance of family. Miguel’s journey through the land of the dead as he pursues his dream has a dramatic shift in tone and direction that is refreshing. The opening of the movie feels so much like a by the numbers “follow your heart” narrative that you could be forgiven for being a little bored by it. Unfortunately, the major plot points require the opening acts to feel mundane in order to play off the expectations of the audience. This is a paradox that many creative movies struggle with when they have unique ideas that need to be built on a mundane foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That mundane foundation is necessary to subvert expectations or to otherwise build up to something special, but the viewer has to get past that barrier to the meat of the story. Fortunately, Pixar has a wealth of humor and beautiful visual spectacles to keep you engaged while it forms the structure that it uses to deliver on its more complex ideas about family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite any blemishes in the narrative, the deeply emotional destination that &lt;em&gt;Coco&lt;/em&gt; arrives at is absolutely worth the ride. Happy tears are hard to come by, but &lt;em&gt;Coco&lt;/em&gt; reached into my heart and squeezed them out of me. I place a very high value on a movie that can draw on that level of depth and produce such a broad range of feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Coco&lt;/em&gt; struggles a little bit with its early narrative, it’s a visual masterpiece that lands with an intense emotional core. This is a must-see film that is a highlight of the already impressive Pixar collection.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/11/2017-11-02-thor-ragnarok.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt; is the product of a continual refinement of a formula that is working very well for Marvel. While not every film in the giant Marvel media machine advances the formula, &lt;em&gt;Thor&lt;/em&gt; has managed to gain ground over both its predecessors and the Marvel catalog as a whole.  Director Taika Waititi has pulled an exceptional film from a talented pool of writers, artists, and actors that excels on a technical level to tell a story that is rich with complex themes and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Thor&lt;/em&gt; works on every level, I want to take the time to focus on the story first. I particularly enjoy films that have something interesting to say, and &lt;em&gt;Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt; reduces some complex ideas about the meaning of success and personal identity. Thor tackles this idea that you can win by changing the definition of the rules of engagement, and it is pretty heady stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, the vast majority of Marvel films have ended with the heroes punching everything better at the end. Getting a deeper exploration of these ideas is highly refreshing. We’ve had hints at more thoughtful plots over the last year with both &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt; ending on more complicated notes. &lt;em&gt;Thor&lt;/em&gt;’s writing is filled with great comedy and action, but be aware, there is real meat here for thoughtful viewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a technical level, I have to give major credit to the creators for composing and executing some of the cleanest action scenes of the year. Despite the large size of most of the fight scenes, they are well-paced and never overpower the narrative. Additionally, their cinematography and directing help the viewer keep firm understanding of everything that is happening, so as an audience we are fully aware of the step-by-step plot points taking place. Keeping your action trimmed and comprehensible like that is a major accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the story, the music is very impressive. Most of the film is filled with original tracks that are inspired by the 80’s, avoiding a &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; style track of licensed music. It hits in a way that is both beautiful and thrilling. There are a few licensed tracks, such as the extremely fitting “Immigrant Song” by Led Zeppelin. There’s some overlap here, as this energy-charged powerhouse of rock moves along the largest of &lt;em&gt;Thor&lt;/em&gt;’s set-piece action scenes. That was, weirdly, a weak point. “Immigrant Song” was used for two of the scenes, and I feel like this robbed it of some of its power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a whole, &lt;em&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt; is the epitome of the current pantheon of films building thoughtfully on everything that came before it. It is a work that feels both new and fresh while reminding you of the best parts of the comics from the past. This is a must watch for any fan of action adventure movies, and an overall excellent work of art.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/11/2017-11-02-goodbye-christopher-robin.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goodbye Christopher Robin&lt;/em&gt; works best when it is exploring family relationships of the upper class in post World War I England. On a less successful level, it tries to explore the damage that writers can do to the lives of those around them. While the acting and music work well, the writing and directing never quite unify enough to deliver on its narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the origin of Winnie-the-Pooh might seem like an unlikely vehicle for discussing the impact of reckless creators, the true story is a real-world example of the damage of unwanted fame. &lt;em&gt;Goodbye Christopher Robin&lt;/em&gt; is the story about how Alan Milne (portrayed by  Domhnall Gleeson) wrote the tales of Winnie-the-Pooh and the resulting aftermath. The core conflict revolves around how he uses the real name of his young son Christopher Robin because he was the inspiration for Milne’s stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting fame of the actual stories about Winnie-the-Pooh brings excessive attention to young Christopher Robin. Before we get to that conflict, though, the story spends a lot of time exploring the life of Alan Milne after he returns from World War I. As a veteran struggling with PTSD, Milne wrestles with finding a place in civilian life and contributing meaningfully via his writing. Milne is eventually struck with inspiration when forced to spend time with his very young child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to point out that I said forced. One of the more interesting aspects of &lt;em&gt;Goodbye Christopher Robin&lt;/em&gt; is the view we get of the relationship between parents and children in this class and time period. Christopher Robin (played by Will Tilston at this point in the story) is raised by his nanny, and this is portrayed as normal. The film has a lot of value as an exploration of this family dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite parts are when Milne finally spends time with Christopher Robin. There’s a natural and amusing chemistry between Gleeson and Tilston. It’s downright heartwarming when they’re bonding while living alone in the countryside and exploring the woods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can tell, there is a lot of story to pack into the narrative. Having to cover so much background before getting to the core conflict undermines the drama. By the time you get to the real struggles that Christopher Robin has to deal with, the movie is three-fourths of the way over and rushing to resolve. The final dramatic moments lose all of their weight due to the accelerated pace, and the conclusion fails to deliver emotionally on any of its core themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I found &lt;em&gt;Goodbye Christopher Robin&lt;/em&gt; to be a fascinating movie with many redeeming elements. Despite failing to successfully build up to its narrative climax, the film does paint a fascinating picture of a certain class and time period. Additionally, it’s filled with endearing and memorable scenes that are rewarding on their own. If you’re in the mood for a leisurely drama and don’t particularly need a strong narrative or final punch, &lt;em&gt;Goodbye Christopher Robin&lt;/em&gt; is fundamentally satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/10/2017-10-23-happy-death-day.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Death Day&lt;/em&gt; fills a nice little niche that has never been touched before. It is exactly the comedy/thriller version of &lt;em&gt;Groundhog Day&lt;/em&gt; that it promises to be. The comedy beats land reliably while the pacing and tone hit the right balance, but the best part was the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a challenge in writing an ending that feels like it fits but also isn’t predictable. Hitting that sweet spot of foreshadowing mixed with surprise kills so many movies. What I loved most about the last act was how it played with the viewer expectations. The ending is a purposeful subversion of the standard morality play. I would say the ending is why I like the movie as much as I do despite its flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could a better writer have done more with the material? Maybe. There are quite a few rough spots in the plot. For instance, there is no real character growth, and what growth there is doesn’t feel earned at all.  But, that may be the point. &lt;em&gt;Happy Death Day&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the same morality tale that you get from &lt;em&gt;Groundhog Day&lt;/em&gt;.  The lack of character growth bothered me; but, thematically it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several times we’re teased with character growth that is hollow or short-lived. These moments support the goals of the film, but they’re distracting. Unfortunately, even though they need to be weak for the ending to work,that doesn’t excuse them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Character development aside, the core story has elements that never fully resolve. &lt;em&gt;Happy Death Day&lt;/em&gt; struggles with its premise. It needs to either address or ignore the reason why the protagonist is living the same day over again. Instead, we get plot points that hint at there being a larger logic but without resolution. These reveals draw attention to what’s happening without giving a satisfying understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to enjoy the film is to not think about why it’s happening. As an audience, we can’t do that if we are given information about it. This remains true even if the information never pays off, because it still causes viewers to think about what is causing her to relive the same day over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area that makes up for the rough spots is the music, which is memorable. It’s got an engaging theme that pops up regularly. Appropriately, it is both slightly haunting and funny. There isn’t much variety to the music, and outside of the main theme there isn’t much that sticks with you afterward, but that’s a weak criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of these areas, the movie is competent, but not exceptional. The acting supports the great moments but doesn’t quite smooth over the bumpy bits. The cinematography is compelling but doesn’t ever elevate the storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, these elements are all just good enough that &lt;em&gt;Happy Death Day&lt;/em&gt; lives and dies by its story. That’s not a bad thing, but it’s also not great. That plot shines pretty bright, and is easy to recommend to those who can enjoy comedy with a hard edge if you can turn off your brain for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/10/2017-10-12-kingsman-the-golden-circle.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Sequels can be extremely difficult to judge independently of their previous film(s), yet &lt;em&gt;Kingsman: The Golden Circle&lt;/em&gt; does an excellent job making it stand on its own. As a sequel to the comic book-based &lt;em&gt;Kingsman: The Secret Service&lt;/em&gt;, this second adventure is a self contained story with subtle ties and references to its predecessor. Action-oriented sequences with a visually distinct style create an enjoyable experience to any fan of the spy genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film immediately jumps into action with a stylized camera sequence that pulls the viewer into every frame. This technique makes the rapid back-and-forth fighting between world class special agents easy to follow with the fight choreography itself being tight, focused, and repetitive. This fun, bouncing, and wildly absurd style lasts until the very end. From the use of an electro-lasso, to a freezing blue slime-bomb, and even a pair of robot dogs named Benny and Jet, the absurdity seems perfectly in place within the world of these super spies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such spies populate the entirety of the story as the opening act establishes the agency as a target for eradication. Eggsy (Taron Egerton), the lead agent, is partnered with Merlin (Mark Strong) on the film’s onset and the story alternates back and forth between their covert operations and the machinations of the villain. We only get a short glimpse at Eggsy’s personal life when it highlights the conflict between his work and his relationships. A source of most of the comedy is from further in where the British agents are forced to journey to the United States and reach out to their long-forgotten brothers-in-arms: The Statesmen. The Kentucky-based, cowboy hat wearing, line dancing, bourbon drinking good ol’ boys are the equal but opposite of their neighbors across the pond, forming a classic team up. The Kingsman are joined by Whiskey (Pedro Pascal) and supported from afar by Merlin and Ginger Ale (Halle Berry) as they piece together the existence of the titular Golden Circle: a global drug cartel plotting to blackmail governments into legalizing their product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delicious character interactions of the heroes unfortunately highlight the blandness the villain, Poppy (Julianne Moore). Presented from the beginning as evil for the sake of being evil, she has no clear motivation beyond wishing to move back to the United States without giving up her illegal business. There is no show of emotion, rationale, nor even ideology behind her entering the drug trade. Even her nostalgia is expressed with the same bland and emotionless smile she has in every scene. This straightforward approach could be forgiven if it was paired with surprising twists instead of the reveals being overtly suggested in advance. Evoking no emotional response, the final twist is used solely for closure and is nothing the audience hasn’t figured out already.
A fun, upbeat, and even comical soundtrack filled with classic folk rock as well as bluegrass cover songs often enhances the more lighthearted parts. Unfortunately, the score itself is merely a punctuation point on otherwise enjoyable scenes. While failing to ever be essential to the emotional response of the viewer, it never feels out of place. The result will leave some wanting more while others are quite satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this film is neither about poignant commentary on illegal trades nor covert operations inherent strain on the relationships of agents. This film is about watching hilarious and exciting action and enjoying the interaction between characters with subtle character development. Though not truly great, &lt;em&gt;Kingsman: The Golden Circle&lt;/em&gt; is unquestioningly an enjoyable escape.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/10/2017-10-06-blade-runner-2049.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t possibly have hoped for a sequel to such a complicated work as good as &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt;. Both thoughtful and engaging, &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt; explores ambitious directions. There will be a lot of debate about whether the subject is as complex as the original, but it provokes thought. By creating a work of art worth discussing, director Denis Villeneuve has created something great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What 2049 does best is capturing the atmosphere of the original. Villeneuve creates a world by spending time looking around showing us what it’s like to live in it. I highly value a film that shows me information, rather than telling it to me. &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; does this more often than not, and &lt;em&gt;2049&lt;/em&gt; follows suit. We see a changed world and the way it has changed is fascinating. Watching &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt; is an experience, and it feels like you could live there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything contributes to the sense of firmness to the setting. The cinematography, the actors, the music, architecture, and dialog blend beautifully into a place that it feels like you could live in. &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt; never once breaks this realism. Long awaited sequels are often served with a wink and a nod. They lace their stories with jokes and cameos that break the immersion. This never happens once, here. The mood never breaks and consistently delivers something that can stand entirely on its own merits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times, though, this works against the film. This willingness to explore the world may be too thoroughly indulged. It’s one of the most memorable aspects of the original, but here the result is a bit over long. I say this with love, too. I like the original, and I like &lt;em&gt;2049&lt;/em&gt;, but 30 minutes before the the end of the movie I was ready for them to wrap things up. Given my love of the material, and appreciation for the original, this is saying something. I don’t know where I would have cut 30 minutes from this film, but it needed to be found somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great deal of what works comes from the plot. I am not comfortable discussing specifics, as I feel the element of discovery contributes greatly to enjoyment. The writers have found some creative spaces with which to explore this breathtaking universe, and it has worked very well for them. There are flaws, but I think that the flaws in the plot are far less significant than the flaws in the pacing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I cannot say if it is better or worse, the music is not the same. It has the same beats, and has a bleakness that is reminiscent of its predecessor, but it lacks a certain mellow musical quality. I miss the light chimes and moments of tenderness. &lt;em&gt;2049&lt;/em&gt; is lacking moments where these would work. At its best the soundtrack creates emotion in the negative space. The way the silence allows you to feel the mood of a scene palpably through the composition of each shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sense  of complexity shows up a lot. There were quite a few moments where I was unsure of how to feel about what I was seeing. While watching a movie, I try to consider what each moment means, and how it contributes to the larger themes. I ultimately am not sure how good &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt; will be considered after it endures the test of time, but for now it is deeply interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s worth stating that this is a difficult movie to rate. The ending isn’t necessarily satisfying, and it sometimes feels like it drags, but… it feels like &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt; is exactly what it is supposed to be. On some level, I don’t even know how something like this gets made. The original &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; cut was famously interfered with and took decades before Ridley Scott was able to cut it into what it is today. For all the things that I didn’t necessarily enjoy, this is a true thematic sequel that delivers on what its predecessor does best, and it is a work of real artistic vision that achieves profound beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like rich and thought-provoking science fiction, you should definitely see &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a beautifully crafted work of art of which every single frame is stunning. This film engages with you and plays with you as you explore its world and characters. I believe that it will be easy to spend hours debating what it means and how well it communicates its messages. Be warned, it’s longer and slower than the original, but if you can get past that you’ll find an important, though flawed, work of fiction that is well worth your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/09/2017-09-25-finding-balance-with-the-orville.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;After the third episode of &lt;em&gt;The Orville&lt;/em&gt;, we’ve seen the range that the series is capable of. I’m happy to say that I am increasingly optimistic.  Often hampered by a need to be silly and comedic, &lt;em&gt;The Orville&lt;/em&gt; shines most as an homage to &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, but with a modern feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like what creator Seth Macfarlane is trying to do with &lt;em&gt;The Orville&lt;/em&gt;. To date, science fiction fans have had two polarized visions of the future: the cold and Utopian &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; and the dirty rebel filled &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Orville&lt;/em&gt; is trying to find humor in having real people in &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;. This is a world filled with idiots and poor decisions, but with a polished civilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it started with absurd story telling and character development with glimpses of this idea, &lt;em&gt;The Orville&lt;/em&gt; is finally showing a glimpse of what it can be. Episode 3, &lt;em&gt;About a Girl&lt;/em&gt;, is reminiscent of  &lt;em&gt;The Measure of a Man&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;About a Girl&lt;/em&gt; tackles some complicated questions in a way that’s only possible through the lens of science fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;About a Girl&lt;/em&gt; two members of a species that is entirely male have a female child. Wanting the best for their child, they decide to have gender reassignment surgery. That idea is a loaded can of worms. There are a lot of different issues you can address with this concept such as either gender equality or transgender-ism. The direction that &lt;em&gt;The Orville&lt;/em&gt; goes with this, tends to lean more toward gender equality, but it doesn’t ignore the larger ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the questions that &lt;em&gt;About a Girl&lt;/em&gt; asks: Is it okay for a culture to force bodily change on infants? Are major changes okay for the purposes of ensuring quality of life? How severe can those changes be? Is there an absolute morality that defines limits to  cultural body modifications? To what end do you accept a culture’s right to make these decisions for their people, or even their infants?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;em&gt;The Orville&lt;/em&gt; gets it right is by not providing answers, only questions. The resolutions divert away from sitcom style resolution and gives a nuanced solution that doesn’t make you feel good. Endings that make you feel good usually don’t make you think very much. What I can say about the ending to &lt;em&gt;About a Girl&lt;/em&gt; is that it made me think. The level of sensitivity and intelligence that the episode had for the core questions was surprising for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was unsure of what &lt;em&gt;The Orville&lt;/em&gt; was capable of when it first aired. If it can capture more of what I got from &lt;em&gt;About a Girl&lt;/em&gt;, then this show could be more than a parody. There is an opportunity here for a unique platform for great science fiction that is also funny. If it continues in this direction, I’m excited for what we’ll get going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/09/2017-09-13-it.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IT&lt;/em&gt; is both wonderfully made and an excellent &lt;em&gt;Goonies&lt;/em&gt;-esque adventure film for adults.  Characterizing this classic Stephen King story as a horror doesn’t quite capture what is happening. &lt;em&gt;IT&lt;/em&gt; is full of scary moments, but the larger story strives to capture growing up with friends. This 2017 remake does that first and foremost, and in so doing captures the spirit of what was most loved of the original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest achievement here is the casting. Hands down, this is the best ensemble cast of child actors I have ever seen, bar none. Both the number of them and the quality per actor was astounding as they are consistently entertaining and convincing. &lt;em&gt;IT&lt;/em&gt; captures a lot of what worked in the Netflix original &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; but the cast of &lt;em&gt;IT&lt;/em&gt; is more reliable. These kids capture a feeling of growing up in the 80’s that feels authentic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the children may be the more impressive part of the casting, &lt;em&gt;IT&lt;/em&gt; is no slouch in any of the rest of the cast. There are no small parts here. As a whole, the cast works together to capture the look, feel, and tone of King’s work. I want to specifically point out Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise the clown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pennywise dominated the trailers with a clown that was overtly scary looking, but in the whole of the film Bill Skarsgård strikes a balance. There are moments where his performance is almost joyous except for the environment. We never quite get the outright fun moments of fun that colored Tim Curry’s performance in the 90’s version, but they aren’t needed either. Overall, Skarsgård knocks it out of the park with a difficult role that follows up an iconic performance by a great actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, the cinematography and direction work well. &lt;em&gt;IT&lt;/em&gt; uses color and framing to set the foundation that the cast builds on. As opposed to contemporary horror films, &lt;em&gt;IT&lt;/em&gt; avoids false jump scares. The core scares are jump scares, but the film uses them to build an emotional narrative that avoids making you jump at moments without delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;em&gt;IT&lt;/em&gt; stumbles a little bit is the story. Stephen King’s 1000 page work is a complex piece of fiction, and any decent translation is an accomplishment. This 2017 film does improve on the original from the 90’s, but is also where &lt;em&gt;IT&lt;/em&gt; stumbles a bit. Character plotlines are occasionally dropped, such as Henry Bowers. Bowers is well developed and one of the more exceptionally developed characters. However, his plotline comes to a sudden halt that fails to deliver on his character arc. This is the most egregious example, but it’s typical of the most noticeable failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those failures aside, &lt;em&gt;IT&lt;/em&gt; manages to capture this wonderful adventure story aesthetic that feels like &lt;em&gt;Goonies&lt;/em&gt; for an audience that is all grown up. Though not quite perfect, &lt;em&gt;IT&lt;/em&gt; is above and beyond reasonable expectations. If you either love a good scare, or can overlook them for a well crafted adventure story, &lt;em&gt;IT&lt;/em&gt; is a must see film that I highly recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/09/2017-09-04-trailers-vs-movies-godzilla-2014.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;The constrained format of movie trailers often highlight the power of editing more than the full length features they represent. Careful editing can entice an audience to attend a film due to the perceived stylistic content of the movie. A captivating trailer can make or break the success of an opening weekend. Follow along with a look at &lt;em&gt;Godzilla&lt;/em&gt; (2014) to see just how an inaccurate trailer can devastate the bottom line of a movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Godzilla is a reboot of a classic international property that used multiple trailers for different markets. This creates the perfect circumstance to examine how a trailer influences the sales within a specific market and how differing trailers can net different turnouts.  Both the American and Asian audiences turned out in droves for the opening weekend, showing a high amount of anticipation. With the follow up weekend being the best indicator of audience satisfaction, these two regions can be fairly compared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second weekend on, &lt;em&gt;Godzilla&lt;/em&gt; had consistent and severe diminishing returns in the American market. Such a severe drop has never been matched by a film that earned over 90 million on its opening weekend. Due to trailers being essential in setting the expectations of an audience, the likelihood that unmet expectations were the largest factor in the drop is high. This suspicion is all but confirmed by the success enjoyed in other regions, such as Asia, where trailers set an entirely different expectation for the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Godzilla&lt;/em&gt; revolves around Aaron Taylor-Johnson’s character and his military escapades trying to stop, not Godzilla, but another giant raging monster. The plot alternates focus between the military (focused on Taylor-Johnson) and the civilian responses (focusing on Elizabeth Olsen). The opening sequence focuses on Bryan Cranston’s character with only bits of dialogue and flashbacks thereafter. Ken Watanabe, while present for the whole film, is largely reduced to a point of plot exposition. Godzilla finally arrives (an hour in) in order to save the day.
In America, the trailer presented voice overs from the most recognizable actors (Ken Watanabe and Bryan Cranston) suggesting they’re responsible for the threat of Godzilla.  Olsen’s role as Taylor-Johnson’s wife is nearly invisible in the trailers, despite having more screen time than Cranston. Audiences are egregiously and purposefully mislead by the trailer presenting Godzilla himself as the threat. The primary conflict isn’t about Godzilla at all, but rather another giant monster which Godzilla eventually rises to fight. That monster unleashed very early in the film yet largely hidden from the trailer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trailer for the Asian markets is quite different with the villainous monster shown multiple times and portrayed as the primary threat. Taylor-Johnson’s character is established as the human most involved in stopping the threat. There are clear indications that Godzilla has arrived to fight the other monster.  Both Cranston and Watanabe’s characters are given a more appropriate representation of lines in this trailer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, &lt;em&gt;Godzilla&lt;/em&gt; did quite well in the Asian market, drawing attention to the difference between them and the the American market in previous Godzilla films. Historically, the American version of Godzilla movies have had their content altered and also edited to portray Godzilla as an extreme danger needing military intervention. Japanese versions highlighted Gojira (the Japanese name) as a defender of the natural way, conflicting with humans over ecological abuse. Americans expected a villainous Godzilla, and that was exactly what the trailers sought to deliver. The unconventional style caught American audiences by surprise, causing them not to return the following weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few films have the luxury of giant international audiences to save them from marketing mistakes as &lt;em&gt;Godzilla&lt;/em&gt; did. Such large discrepancies are not easily explained away by cultural differences. The overwhelming success it enjoyed in markets that had an accurate trailer suggests the film’s overall quality is satisfactory. The only markets that lacked in sales were the ones with misleading trailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s too easy to say this trailer resulted in a good movie not getting the reception it deserved.  Failure to meet viewer expectations can leave a movie watcher spurned on an otherwise enjoyable experience. Honesty isn’t nearly as important in trailers as is presenting reachable expectations so that audiences are consistently satisfied. Hollywood still hasn’t figured that one out yet.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/08/2017-08-11-the-glass-castle.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;I am not able to objectively review &lt;em&gt;The Glass Castle&lt;/em&gt;.  This is a film that deals with the struggles that come from an abusive home when trying to move on and define who you are as an adult. It approaches it from a sensitive direction and paints a beautiful and complex picture of the abuser. This subject resonated with me on a very personal level and was cathartic to watch, making it difficult for me to see its flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most authentic part of the experience is how Woody Harrelson portrays his character, Rex. Even during the darkest and most awful moments, he would bring just a touch of humor and love. Those attributes are pretty meaningful to the texture of the trauma depicted. When Woody was able to make me chuckle right before almost making me cry, it reminded me of exactly how I’ve felt when I was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as Woody Harrelson captures the essence of the abuser, Brie Larson’s performance as Jeannette Walls is relatable. The catharsis of &lt;em&gt;The Glass Castle&lt;/em&gt; comes from the struggle of Jeannette to love her abusive father as a damaged human being while at the same time forging her own life. Moving past abuse is a constant struggle, and you are never truly healed. Brie Larson captures that in her nuanced portrayal of an adult dealing with parents who cannot care for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of why this works so well is the plot construction. The focus of the story is on Jeannette Walls as an adult, navigating a path to a satisfying life. During the story of her self discovery, the narrative cuts to frequent flashbacks of growing up. As we see her in her present, we slowly get a picture of the forces that shaped her into who she is. As the audience, we get to clinically examine her past, the same way she is able to at this stage in her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cinematography is mesmerizing, as it captures the subtle beauty of a world that doesn’t quite exist anymore. The director doesn’t simply show us small towns, desserts, and mountain-side homes, they show us the humanity in these places. It feels a like being there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The music, though competent, fails to stand out. It holds everything together, but doesn’t shine or contribute anything special of its own to this story. I can’t recall a single melody from the entire thing. This is better than remembering it for being poorly done or out of place, but it is an opportunity to have been more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to remember this movie for a long time. It helped me view my own life through a helpful lens. It’s not every day that a movie can touch a person like that. There’s no way I can fairly judge a movie that helped me heal as a person. All I can say, is that I highly recommend &lt;em&gt;The Glass Castle&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a beautiful film that may make you both cry and laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/08/2017-08-03-the-dark-tower.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dark Tower&lt;/em&gt; is to its source material as coffee flavored ice cream is to coffee. While missing the things that define coffee, the ice cream is something good with that unmistakable flavor. If what you really want is coffee, then you won’t be happy, but otherwise you’re likely to enjoy it. The movie is missing the greater mythology, characters, and most of the themes but is a coherent adventure story with lots of &lt;em&gt;Dark Tower&lt;/em&gt; flavor to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge in converting an 8-book epic, especially one as expansive as &lt;em&gt;The Dark Tower&lt;/em&gt;, into a digestible or even enjoyable experience is unbelievable. However, that is exactly what this film accomplishes. It’s not the same as reading the books and doesn’t deliver the same experience; but, you’ll get a fun ride that’s well-paced, coherent, and fueled by engaging performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performances from Idris Elba and  Matthew McConaughey steal the show here. Their work is the best reason to watch the movie. McConaughey dives into the role of the villain with an almost comical enthusiasm. It’s a delight to watch, especially as it plays off of Elba’s performance as Roland the gunslinger. His hard-as-nails persona isn’t surprising, as you can see it in recent films such as &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Beyond&lt;/em&gt;. The two work so well together that I could enjoy seeing them together more often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom Taylor plays the lead role of Jake Chambers. As far as child actors go, he’s okay. His delivery during the core emotional moments fail to feel convincing, but the director (Nikolaj Arcel) mutes this weakness by cutting those scenes with flashbacks. It’s a neat little trick that gives Taylor more room to breathe and removes a little of the weight off of his performance.  There were no particularly weak performances here to steal from what worked well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, the story fails to capture almost any of the essence of the books, but that would be an impossible task. That’s almost a benefit. While it won’t satisfy fans of the source completely, it is a fun diversion that doesn’t require 8 books of investment to enjoy. The texture that the universe gets from the books gives it a rich background to tell its story in. Stephen King created some beautiful characters and locations that live and breathe even in this muted version of his world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d be lying if I pretended not to be sad about the lack of greater depth and meaning from King’s work. Not very much gets used here, and I didn’t like that so much was missing. I can’t help but feel like there could have been a little more purpose to the movie given how much the books have. This will keep people who wanted the very specific things that this series delivers unhappy if they’re unable to keep from comparing the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this keeps &lt;em&gt;The Dark Tower&lt;/em&gt; from transcending the action genre, it doesn’t keep it from being one of the most fun movies of the summer. VIewers will be treated to a well crafted adventure with great actors and a certain flavor that you can’t get from anywhere else. If you’re looking for a fun ride, &lt;em&gt;The Dark Tower&lt;/em&gt; is definitely worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/07/2017-07-23-valerian-and-the-city-of-a-thousand-planets.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets&lt;/em&gt; (we’re going to call it &lt;em&gt;Valerian&lt;/em&gt; for short) is a flawed film that is particularly disappointing given its pedigree. Between the director, source material, and actors, &lt;em&gt;Valerian&lt;/em&gt; had all the right ingredients. There is enough good left that a viewer may enjoy the ride, but it would be in spite of the flaws. The big problems are with  the story and acting,  both unpleasant to point of being distracting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything starts to fall apart with the acting first. There are two lead roles in the film: Major Valerian (Dane DeHaan) and Sergeant Laureline (Cara Delevingne). While Cara does an acceptable portrayal of Laureline, Dane DeHaan adopts an unpleasant growl every time he talks. He delivers his lines as though he were Christian Bale in the role of Batman. Every word feels like an uncomfortable imitation of a masculine grunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Dane DeHaan is the standout, a few other actors never feel right. Clive Owen, who is usually awesome, never quite feels natural in his role. Rihanna gives a good performance, but her role is all about her just being Rihanna. That would be more distracting if the movie around her were better, but she is still a lot of fun. Her cameo is also bundled with Ethan Hawke who is getting way more fun as he gets older. I am constantly looking forward to everything he does, now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the performances that shine don’t make up for the damage of the bad ones. When the delivery is unconvincing it amplifies the surrounding issues. Valerian’s core story arc as a character is his love story with Laureline, and you never feel good about the characters talking together. While DeHaan’s performance undermines this side story, the story itself is problematic. This gets into the story problems that &lt;em&gt;Valerian&lt;/em&gt; suffers from. Though the story and plot suffer from issues, the love story drowns out those problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to mention that the love story runs counter to character arcs in the graphic novels, but this is not why it’s bad. The romance is flat, never feels like it requires sacrifice, and is delivered almost entirely in exposition. There is heavy-handed exposition throughout the film, but it is by far the most overt and awkward in the love story. It’s so blunt and aggressively inserted that it takes the foreground even though it’s a background story. The romantic interest is the first thing we know about Valerian and Laureline and the last thing we see them dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything that is wrong with the love story is exacerbated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gc72RUcpLdk&quot;&gt;Dehaan’s performance&lt;/a&gt;. If you could isolate this subplot from the film, every single element of it would be awful. If you can get past that, and overlook DeHaan’s performance, there’s a clever if flawed science fiction adventure film to be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main plot is a  cheesy conflict between an idealized primitive culture against and the human military complex. While not good, this isn’t inherently bad. I mean, hey, it worked for &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt;. I don’t feel like any of the problems with the main story are so broken that this couldn’t have been as good as Luc Besson’s &lt;em&gt;The Fifth Element&lt;/em&gt;. That classic was also inspired by the &lt;em&gt;Valerian and Laureline&lt;/em&gt; comics, and also written and directed by Luc Besson. &lt;em&gt;The Fifth Element&lt;/em&gt; is one of my all time favorite movies despite a plot that is somewhat silly and naive. At the end of that movie, Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich literally save the universe with the power of love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that the problem is that the director was at odds with the source material. While &lt;em&gt;The Fifth Element&lt;/em&gt; was an original story with characters written from the ground up to be together, &lt;em&gt;Valerian&lt;/em&gt; uses some well established characters. It borrows enough from them that the romance doesn’t work. However, love appears to be a theme with Besson and science fiction. Looking back at what makes &lt;em&gt;The Fifth Element&lt;/em&gt; special, you find this ideal where love fixes everything. The world is full of violence and pain, but the love is what makes life worth living. And, though cheesy, that’s kind of beautiful. It can work, but if Besson needed the movie to have that message, maybe he should not have done a direct translation of &lt;em&gt;Valerian and Laureline&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this source material it was important to differentiate from &lt;em&gt;The Fifth Element&lt;/em&gt;. This source material has inspired countless works of brilliant science fiction, and it deserves to have a unique voice.  There are even some incredible moments where that voice shines through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the first 5 minutes of the film captures a touching vision of humanity. It shows us stepping outside of the bounds of earth, unifying, and becoming a part of a greater universe. It’s done so well that it may be the best example of this message in all of science fiction.  Even still, though, this runs counter to the themes of the main plot. This ideal of a better humanity is undermined by a story about how poorly our military behaves. The juxtaposition is poorly done, and it’s a little bit tragic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were plenty of moments where I genuinely laughed. Some of the best moments were in the side plots when the story would run off the tracks. This and Rihanna’s cameo didn’t add to the main plot, but in so many ways they were better than the main story. In that, they were some of the best parts to watch. The action is well filmed and enjoyable. Visually, &lt;em&gt;Valerian&lt;/em&gt; is colorful in a way that science fiction has needed to be for years. Finally, the world building is a blast. Everywhere the characters go takes them on a path through a vibrant setting filled with amazing aliens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish &lt;em&gt;Valerian&lt;/em&gt; had better executed its story and delivered better performances. There are a lot of wonderful moments and characters here, but they’re undercut by the poor writing and acting. This was a chance to make a classic that may have eclipsed some of the greatest science fiction ever made, but Luc Besson missed the mark. I do not recommend &lt;em&gt;Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets&lt;/em&gt;. Check out the first five minutes if it’s ever on Netflix or YouTube, but turn it off before Dane DeHaan gets a chance to open his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/07/2017-07-19-dunkirk.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Writer/Director Christopher Nolan surprised me by working on a movie about the Battle of Dunkirk. The short and sweet story had me expecting a drama more focused on a fictional narrative. &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Saving Private Ryan&lt;/em&gt; set the bar for historical dramas for the past 20 years. I was completely wrong. &lt;em&gt;Dunkirk&lt;/em&gt; is an intense and unforgiving experience that can be punishing to endure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first areas which surprised me was the amount of dialog. The verbal communication in &lt;em&gt;Dunkirk&lt;/em&gt; is so sparse that I never stopped expecting the story to “start”. Words get handed out like precious gems, each one with a specific purpose and meaning. While minimalist, this lets Nolan focus on letting you feel the importance of each event. It’s not only the dialog, either; every frame of the film feels important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nolan uses the straightforward narrative of a well-catalogued series of events to flex his editing muscles. Even when the characters are silent, we know what they’re thinking. By the time it’s important, we know the weight of the dangers each character must choose between. Additionally, we know the cost of their possible choices. We experience their agency on the story through their eyes and the information they have. Then, we experience that agency through the fog of the noise surrounding the characters and an oppressive musical score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The score amplifies the tension of such a personal connection to the characters. Nolan challenges his audience with heart-pounding loud music set to subtextual acting. The tracks have moments filled with the ticking of time marching on as the tension ratchets up for the characters to make a decision. When we see a new choice that they have to make, we are shown the consequences of either choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cumulative result feels like someone looked at the beach scene in from &lt;em&gt;Saving Private Ryan&lt;/em&gt; and said, “Why isn’t this the whole movie?” It is physically stressful. I let out a sigh of relief when the credits rolled, and I hadn’t even noticed I was holding my breath. A lot of people will find this too intense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot say that it is entirely positive that the movie is so intense. There is never a moment for you to catch up on an emotional level. This is an achievement, but maybe not one that improves the experience. You’re struggling for survival with each character from beginning to end; then, when it’s all over, you don’t feel necessarily good about it. You feel ambiguous, as ambiguous as you can about the miraculous rescue of 300,000 lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third tier to the quality of this film is the performances that Nolan manages to get out of his cast. Both Cillian Murphy and Tom Hardy, regulars in the films of Christopher Nolan (and for good reason), disappear into their roles. These performances are reminiscent of the work of Gary Oldman, and that is high praise. Every single actor worked to serve the larger purpose of the film, and no performance felt weaker than the others. This is the quality of acting that is most noticeable for how much you don’t notice it. Most viewers won’t even think about the acting because it feels transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dunkirk&lt;/em&gt; is a movie that should be experienced if you can handle it. There’s something important here to talk about in how we enjoy our war films, particularly those featuring World War II. Ultimately, &lt;em&gt;Dunkirk&lt;/em&gt; is the type of movie that brings this discussion out without shouting it. Be warned that it is gripping and uncomfortable, but it may be Christopher Nolan’s greatest work of art.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/07/2017-07-18-atomic-blonde.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atomic Blonde&lt;/em&gt; is a good movie that satisfies a very specific kind of taste, if not much else. I liked it because it addresses a craving for visceral and brutal conflict in rare form. Moreover, it does so with a style that defines its environments with color and sound. Unfortunately, a need to have the audience think that it’s clever undermines the positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charlize Theron portrays Lorraine Broughton, an MI6 agent sent to Cold War era Berlin. Theron is no stranger to physically challenging roles. In &lt;em&gt;Aeon Flux&lt;/em&gt; she demonstrated a great aptitude for gymnastics and choreography. More recently, she made a strong turn in &lt;em&gt;The Fate of the Furious&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year. &lt;em&gt;Atomic Blonde&lt;/em&gt; should cement her as a powerhouse of an action star that rivals Scarlett Johansson. Additionally, she has the acting chops to match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Theron wasn’t alone, as the whole cast turned in top notch performances. I particularly enjoyed the work of James McAvoy, John Goodman, and Toby Jones. Charlize Theron has completely out done herself, though. She’s a thrill to watch and will stand out for years as the best part of &lt;em&gt;Atomic Blonde&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capable cast move with fluidity through a breathtaking depiction of Berlin. From a visual perspective, the graphic novel roots of &lt;em&gt;Atomic Blonde&lt;/em&gt; are recognizable. Even when considering recent movies such as &lt;em&gt;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Atomic Blonde&lt;/em&gt; stands out as a vibrant and crisply defined portrayal of the cold war. The city itself bleeds color and personality in every shot. The heavy electronic remixes of classic 80’s tunes that highlight the soundtrack blend with the style to create a nervous sense of oppression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved how this movie looked and how it felt. The action was frantic, but clear and coherent. Both aggressive and well paced, the long form fight sequences will stand out for decades as a defining moment in action cinema. While &lt;em&gt;Atomic Blonde&lt;/em&gt; has other merits, this one will be what audiences remember most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes it fall flat for me is how shallow it is. More than once I found a clever little detail in a scene, or noticed a line of dialog that felt clever, only to have a character point it out. It’s like the movie is so afraid of appearing thoughtless that it has to tell you every time it performs a trick. &lt;em&gt;Atomic Blonde&lt;/em&gt; suffers from trying too hard rather than letting you appreciate it. This breaks the fundamental rule of film making: show, don’t tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This desperation is most evident in the end of the movie. The whole story culminates into a mystery of which character is on which side. I have seen this done well, but here, I already barely care by the time it starts. By about the third time a character switched sides I stopped caring at all. A good twist ending should change how the whole movie feels leading up to that moment. The twist should re-frame the information that you thought you knew, provoking you to review the events of the story. Sadly, that’s where &lt;em&gt;Atomic Blonde&lt;/em&gt; fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tragically, the sides don’t matter in the end, because they never mattered. You don’t ever feel like they’re important, even when you need to care what’s happening. This doesn’t ruin the movie, but it holds it back from being particularly good. Viewers like myself will be impacted more heavily by these flaws due to how core they are to the end, closing the experience on a sour note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atomic Blonde&lt;/em&gt; is a better than average action flick that accomplishes some amazing things. A more self confident execution and a more thoughtful ending would have made this a film to remember. You will get beautiful cinematography as well as some of the most proficiently choreographed fights set to film. If you can appreciate the brutality or crave atmospheric period pieces, &lt;em&gt;Atomic Blonde&lt;/em&gt; is for you. If not, then it’s likely to disappoint you.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/07/2017-07-15-amy-pascal-cant-let-spider-man-fail.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Spider-man: Homecoming&lt;/em&gt; hitting theaters last weekend, there is perhaps one person that watched closer than anyone. With a weekend box office return of over 100 million, Producer Amy Pascal may finally be relaxing, but she still has a lot of her reputation riding on this film’s debut. The average movie goer likely has no idea why, though.
Amy Pascal was a name made infamous by last year’s &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters (2016)&lt;/em&gt; film. That movie was plagued with a slew of controversies derived as much from the film production crew as the often immature or offensive public responses. The story has been written about at length, so I will only touch on the few moments relevant to Pascal’s current role as producer. No one can escape their past, however, so we cannot dismiss these things completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand why this production is so important for Amy Pascal, we have to go back to the start of her Sony Pictures career. Back in 2006, Pascal (already a veteran of the business side of movie making with Columbia pictures) became co-chairperson of Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE). Under her high-level oversight, SPE produced many hugely successful movies: the Daniel Craig Bond movies, the Spider-Man movies, and several Academy Award winning films, to name a few. No doubt Pascal was part of the recipe for the success SPE enjoyed under her leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As time rolled on, the rosy picture of Pascal’s abilities started to dim. There were accusations of extravagant salaries for personal assistants, frequent flights on private jets, and Pascal’s own salary was an exorbitant 3 million annually. These issues are reason enough to push her out of the Co-Chairperson position; that’s where Pascal’s story takes a curious turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early December of 2015, just months before Pascal’s contract with SPE was set to expire, there was a massive release of hacked emails. Exposing her to public scrutiny, these emails exposed an over-optimistic Pascal being extremely bullish, estimating record-breaking sales for a slew of films in the Spider-Man franchise. Notes from meetings revealed she repeatedly over-valued the success of &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&lt;/em&gt;, and imagined its sequel would break a billion worldwide sales. A planned Tobey Maguire/Andrew Garfield crossover Spider-Man movie would make, in her estimation, over 2 billion (to date, only 3 films, released years apart, have ever reached that value). Even more shocking was the assumption that the Spider-Man franchise would only need five years to be worth more than the total of all Marvel Studios productions. The timing of these unrealistic expectations and the recent insensitive remarks overshadowed her departure from the company 3 months premature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though, there are two other actions revealed from the hacks that make her current decisions the subject of scrutiny. First, the hacks revealed that she had made highly insensitive comments about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-amy-pascal-email-rogen-hirai-20150205-story.html&quot;&gt;President Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;. Second, her involvement in several films which she fought to pay women considerably less than both the men and herself was more damaging to her brand. This gave an impression of lining her own pockets at the expense of those under her employ. For a person who stated their major goal as producer has been to improve minority representation in modern film, these leaks in particular indicate she may have ulterior motives.
No doubt hoping to repair her name, Pascal founded her own production company upon leaving SPE, and was promptly contracted back with them to do just that. The fact that she was placed back onto the new Spider-Man project shows that the company had high faith in her abilities despite the controversy. She had another, ill-fated project to advance before she could get back to the web-slinger: The aforementioned &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt; movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a production budget of 150 million (a high percentage of which went to the director and leading actress) and a large but undisclosed marketing budget, &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt; had high stakes. The casting, interviews, and trailers all pushed a narrative that the movie was to be a flagship of women-lead action movies, and any criticisms were dismissed as misguided or offensive (even coming from the movie’s star, Melissa McCarthy). When the movie &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/ghostbusters-box-office-loss&quot;&gt;failed to earn all of that back&lt;/a&gt;, Pascal’s judgment was called into question again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterward, details about the new Spider-Man production rolled out. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geek.com/tech/spider-man-homecoming-has-a-first-poster-and-casting-madness-1667540/&quot;&gt;Curious casting choices&lt;/a&gt; were made that drastically changed the looks (and sometimes the names) of classic characters. The motives for such casting were highlighted by the choice of Tony Revolori to play Flash Thompson (star football player and Peter’s frequent bully) This was the largest departure from the source material, as Tony is significantly shorter than the rest of the cast and not physically intimidating. Not looking like the comics took a backseat to fears he would be less believable as a bully. Many casting choices were hailed by the general public as perfect page-to-screen translations: Michael Keaton (Adrian Toomes), Tom Holland (Peter Parker aka Spider-man) and Jacob Batalon (Peter’s best friend Ned).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The casting could be seen as an appropriate update considering the teenagers are all attending a public school in Queens. Spider-Man co-creator Stan Lee seemed extremely confident in the new film’s choice for MJ. Stan Lee’s blessing is as high praise as possible for the geek world. However, with Pascal’s history of speaking up for underrepresented minorities often being coupled with low pay for those actors, the authenticity of her desire for a balanced cast becomes suspect. Were the more questionable casting choices merely due to a complete lack of understanding of the source material? Or worse, is this a heartless attempt to capitalize on a movie going populace that wants to see better representation in their films? Let’s hope none of these are the case with the true motive was for the purpose of making a good and successful movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the answer, this new movie will prove whether or not Amy Pascal’s slate gets a fresh cleaning. In all likelihood, a success will largely be attributed to Marvel Studios’ cooperative efforts on the film (it stars several actors from the Marvel Cinematic Universe). If Amy Pascal is actually exploiting underrepresented minorities for profit, this will unfortunately provide her cover to continue doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/07/2017-07-08-disappointment-of-rough-night.markdown":"&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This article contains spoilers for both &lt;em&gt;Rough Night&lt;/em&gt; and Very Bad things. If you wish to watch either of these films without bias, you should view them before reading on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When discussing art, it is important to pay attention to the context it exists in. Art does not exist in a vacuum and good art can create meaning in contrast against similar works. &lt;em&gt;Rough Night&lt;/em&gt; is interesting to discuss because of how it compares to its peers and predecessors. It draws on modern comedies, such as &lt;em&gt;Baywatch&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The House&lt;/em&gt;, to contrast against, and it is directly comparable to &lt;em&gt;Very Bad Things&lt;/em&gt;, a comedy from 1998.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rough Night&lt;/em&gt; is about a group of women reuniting for a bachelorette party in Florida. This is their first time meeting in years and a chance to celebrate their friendship. Struggling with adult problems has pulled them apart, and all of them feel it. After cocaine-fueled partying around Miami in the middle of the night, things take a turn. The girls hire a stripper to entertain them as the night winds down, and while having their fun, the stripper tragically dies. This premise is dark, but the film never delivers on that darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may turn off some with its subject, the talented actresses made me laugh. &lt;em&gt;Rough Night&lt;/em&gt; is funny. For what it’s worth, &lt;em&gt;Rough Night&lt;/em&gt; is well-made in that the director made exactly what she wanted. The message in &lt;em&gt;Rough Night&lt;/em&gt; should be more important than its quality, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot of &lt;em&gt;Rough Night&lt;/em&gt; uses a common “Man in a Hole” plot. The protagonist of the story starts out wanting something bigger than they have. They fall down a hole and struggle with finding a way to get out. Then, when they get out again, they do so in a way that has them better off than they were before they fell in the hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buddy comedies that use this plot have a pretty good formula to work with. A group of friends getting into a difficult situation is a great lens for looking at friendships. The challenge should highlight the texture of the character relationships. Their crisis should bring out their disagreements and the needs that bring them together… When done well, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the ways that subpar films sabotage this classic plot is by messing with the core event. These stories hinge on the predicament the characters get into. Writers will sometimes try to make their story edgier by contriving extreme predicaments. These extreme events get harder to resolve believably and often become the focus of the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This undermines the core purpose of the film: the friendships. Additionally, it also breaks suspension of disbelief for the viewer. You end up with ridiculous endings, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2kZNF334KY&quot;&gt;kidnappings resolved with heartfelt speeches&lt;/a&gt;. These over-the-top plot devices are a real problem, and they’re rampant in the comedy genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many modern comedies do attempt to address this problem, though. In last year’s &lt;em&gt;Keanu&lt;/em&gt;, the protagonists are given a more realistic ending even though they’re the good guys. This year’s &lt;em&gt;Baywatch&lt;/em&gt; tries to deal with this problem by pointing out flaws in its own plot throughout the film. It’s a positive trend in modern comedies to acknowledge their silliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decades ahead of its time, &lt;em&gt;Very Bad Things&lt;/em&gt; addressed the problem of increasingly absurd comedic plots in 1998. &lt;em&gt;Very Bad Things&lt;/em&gt; is about a group of men preparing for a bachelor party in Nevada. They’ve grown apart emotionally even though they see each other frequently and they use the party as a chance to celebrate their friendship. After cocaine-fueled partying around Las Vegas in the middle of the night, things take a turn. The guys hire a stripper to entertain them as the night winds down, and while having their fun, the stripper tragically dies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this should sound familiar. The beginning of the story for &lt;em&gt;Very Bad Things&lt;/em&gt; is nearly identical to that of &lt;em&gt;Rough Night&lt;/em&gt;. They both try to imagine the most extreme possible crisis for their protagonists. However, in a time where many comedies place their characters in increasingly dire and horrible circumstances, &lt;em&gt;Very Bad Things&lt;/em&gt; stands out from the crowd. After the initial crisis, &lt;em&gt;Very Bad Things&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rough Night&lt;/em&gt; go in completely different directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the opening in &lt;em&gt;Very Bad Things&lt;/em&gt;, the characters immediately kill again. One of the protagonists stabs a security guard who has discovered the body of their first victim; then they all trap the guard in a room, holding the door shut together. The violence is brief, and it is over in a flash. We’re left with all 5 friends desperately holding the door shut as we hear the guard inside thrash about. The audience sees only horrified faces of the protagonists as they react to the fading sounds of desperate struggle behind them until only silence remains. This scene is harrowing, and it tells us that what has just happened isn’t funny and shouldn’t be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, this crisis becomes a poison at the heart of every relationship. It fractures the life of each character and makes everything they touch toxic. There are jokes, but &lt;em&gt;Very Bad Things&lt;/em&gt; never absolves anyone of their crimes. Every character ends in a miserable place: dead, stuck in a toxic relationship, paralyzed, or tormented. They pay for their poor judgement and inability to function as adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Very Bad Things&lt;/em&gt; is an uncomfortable experience. It gets &lt;em&gt;DARK&lt;/em&gt;. Even now, almost 20 years after its release, it’s challenging to watch. Any laughter will be nervous laughter. Audiences may be ready to enjoy this story in another ten years, but even today it is hard to enjoy. That said, it is a good movie. It turns silly “Man in a Hole” comedies on their head by taking its extreme premise to a logical conclusion. The direction of the story causes it to work as a satire and as a reflection of the state of comedy at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where does &lt;em&gt;Rough Night&lt;/em&gt; go wrong? Right after setting the stage. It begins to introduce slapstick elements. We see characters unharmed by accidents that would seriously injure or kill a person. Events like this are representative of the larger failure: the death is eventually forgiven and none of the protagonists experience any consequences. This systemic removal of responsibility from the characters transforms &lt;em&gt;Rough Night&lt;/em&gt; into a cheap comedy and abandons any chance for it to be meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the film ends, &lt;em&gt;Rough Night&lt;/em&gt; uses manslaughter as a bonding experience for the protagonists. It contorts logic so that the women can walk away from a tragic accident as better friends and without consequences. Everyone is happier, and their lives are improved because they have killed together. While &lt;em&gt;Very Bad Things&lt;/em&gt; is deeply upsetting to watch, &lt;em&gt;Rough Night&lt;/em&gt; is horrifying if you think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s only horrifying in the negative space around the story. You have to think about the implications of what you’re watching to see it. &lt;em&gt;Rough Night&lt;/em&gt; is a return to the era of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCTgcZ6ImsQ&quot;&gt;Weekend at Bernie’s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; where everything is better if you just laugh at the situation and ignore what it means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good movies have weight and make us feel their consequences. They leave an impression and provoke us to think critically about art and life. If you watch &lt;em&gt;Very Bad Things&lt;/em&gt;, then you’re likely to hate it. You’ll feel upset and uncomfortable, but that is why &lt;em&gt;Very Bad Things&lt;/em&gt; is good. 10 years from now, it will still be worth talking about while &lt;em&gt;Rough Night&lt;/em&gt; will be lost in the crowd. Even if you kind of like &lt;em&gt;Rough Night&lt;/em&gt;, being likeable isn’t good enough to be important or even particularly memorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rough Night&lt;/em&gt; had the opportunity, the ingredients, and a template to say something. It could have explored gender roles and maturity through a lens that uses &lt;em&gt;Very Bad Things&lt;/em&gt; to contrast against. The potential was there to make a statement that we didn’t have the cinematic language for in 1998. But &lt;em&gt;Rough Night&lt;/em&gt; fails to do any of this, comparing poorly both to its modern peers and to its predecessor, and that is disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/06/2017-06-29-the-beguiled.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;The Beguiled is an example of technical film making that is too restrained. There is a lot to like here if you set your expectations right, and it would have been more enjoyable if the advertising had matched the product. Director Sofia Coppola captures a slow rhythm that produces palpable environments. This blossoms in a way that I appreciate. The cast delivers performances that reinforce this sense of texture, too. I can even praise the story for having believable character choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a model work of fiction, the action of each character drives the plot forward. It’s important that their behaviors make sense. Even when we don’t agree with their choices, the audience needs to understand them. The Beguiled excels at this. As a thriller, it uses this series of events and makes the outcome inevitable. When it reaches the climax, The beguiled clearly couldn’t have ended any other way. I love it when a plot captures that sense of inevitability. Unfortunately, the plot is too straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where this breaks down, is that there’s no sense of voice. The lead role, Miss Martha, is too even headed. It never once feels like she makes a decision out of weakness, selfishness, or spite. This restraint of character action keeps the movie from saying anything interesting. By being too rational, the conflict feels one-sided, and some tension gets lost. One of the selling points of The Beguiled is the idea of a man becoming the victim of women whom he has wronged, but he &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; feels like a victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had there even been a hint that spite drove Miss Martha’s decisions, the story would have gained a wealth of depth. I cannot say whether the narrative or the directing omitted these needed elements, but it definitely wasn’t the acting. Nicole Kidman commands the lead role of Miss Martha. She leads the way in experience and poise, stealing the show. Colin Farrell delivers an entertaining performance, though he is one of the problems. He is too unlikable to sympathize with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His cowardice, judgement, and insincerity feel greasy from nearly the beginning. These characteristics bloom in response to the misfortunes that befall his character, Corporal McBurney. Each injury pulls more insecurity and aggression from within Corporal McBurney. Colin Farrell pulls this off, but it’s too much, and his performance makes those tragedies feel justified. Necessary, even. If either Miss Martha had been less sympathetic or Corporal McBurney more so, then The Beguiled would have felt more meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real saving grace here is the scene construction. Our eyes get to linger on the landscape. Sofia gives us time to soak in the subtle day to day life in this place. Isolated country roads that echo the warm melodies of a softly-hummed tune transport you to a different time, and a different place.  As a dramatic period piece, The Beguiled excels. I get the impression that Sofia was trying to make something deeper than that, though, and it doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Beguiled doesn’t deliver on the promise of an indulgent revenge film, but I liked what I got. It’s worth watching for its luxurious ambiance, meticulous plot construction, and compelling acting. Not a must see film, but if you’re in the mood for that kind of slow burning period piece and only have an hour and a half, it will scratch that itch beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/06/2017-06-23-baby-driver.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Baby Driver does a lot of things right, but what it does best is weave its music into every scene with perfection. Director Edgar Wright is at the top of his game and each moment is fun and engaging. Where he shines above all else, though, is in that soundtrack. This is a full multimedia experience that makes any frame a work of audio and visual storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other films that define themselves by their tracklist, the music here is essential. Attentive viewers will note that all of the tracks we hear are a part of the scene. That music connects us to the character and represents what Baby himself is hearing.  He sings to it, mouths the lyrics, dances to it, and you can see that the melodies have a physical presence in each moment. This tangible element to the melodies sets Baby Driver apart from the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also really appreciated that it didn’t feel like the same tracks I’ve heard repeatedly in music-heavy films. The tracklist is diverse and a little bit obscure. It’s noticeably fresh and thoughtful. One of the first things I did after walking out of the movie was dig into some of the gems all throughout that I don’t hear very often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost as good as the sound is the acting. Over-the-top performances from Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, John Hamm, Lily James, Ansel Elgort, and Jon Bernthal all rock the theater. I cannot express how much fun Kevin Spacey is to watch in everything he does. The worst parts of the movie, heavy-handed expositions, are completely forgivable when they flow from Spacey’s lips. The man may be one of the best actors alive today. He is interesting and compelling no matter what role he takes. Additionally, you can tell that every single person around him is striving to keep pace, which elevates the overall quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weakest element here is the story. Baby Driver is beautiful for the ways that it explores storytelling, scene construction, character development, and even for how it evolves car chases, but Shakespeare it is not. The plot is a blunt instrument that allows Edgar Wright and the cast to stand out in high contrast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s not a bad story. Baby Driver is a crime drama about a kid in debt to a criminal mastermind. He pays his debt by driving getaway cars from high profile heists. Though he wants out, Baby is compelled back in through threats of violence.  Even in this clear-cut narrative, Baby Driver manages to subvert expectations and produce three-dimensional characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these wonderful elements helped me forgive the things that are subpar here. There’s plenty of exposition, and while delivered in a playful and enjoyable tone, it’s still heavy-handed and noticeable. I’m a little disappointed that Edgar Wright didn’t find more to say with the narrative. Though filled with moving sound and an original voice, Baby Driver is satisfied to be a popcorn flick. It may be one of the best popcorn flicks ever made, and that is a high distinction, but it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any love at all for intense action, enthralling acting, heart-pumping music, or meticulous directing, you’ll love it. Baby Driver is the best thrill ride in years, and I spent the whole film almost dancing in my seat.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/06/2017-06-14-the-book-of-henry.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;The Book of Henry is an excellent movie in every respect that works on several levels. I was expecting this to be a better than average movie for young adults, but the quality surprised me. The story has insight into maturity highlighted by detail oriented scene construction. The meticulous construction of the already smart story results in a film that had me on the edge of my seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, The Book of Henry is about contrasting maturity against intelligence. We explore this theme by viewing the relationship of Henry and his mother Susan. Henry is a child prodigy who handles his mother’s stock options, expenses, and some life decisions. Susan plays games, slacks off with friends, works at a job she doesn’t need, and struggles with adulthood. In many ways Henry seems like the more mature character before the film challenges this idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he realizes his neighbor is being abused by her father ( Glenn Sickleman), Henry tries to help her. In a lot of ways, he follows the standard channels for helping an abuse victim. He attempts speaking to school authorities and calling child protective services. After being thwarted at every turn, Henry decides that the only way to help is to murder Glenn. The drama of the story swells from Henry’s mother and her response to this plan given her struggles as a parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt that the only failing of The Book of Henry is a common one in modern stories. When we reach the end of the film, the audience gets to have their cake and eat it, too. It has that moment where the good guys choose to take the high road, but the bad guys still get punished. It undermines the decision of the characters to solve their problems the right way. Audiences will most likely find this gratifying, but it disappointed me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though this feels like a story for children, it goes into some dark places. Director Colin Trevorrow goes right up to the edge of very painful subject matter without showing it. There were moments that were uncomfortable for me to watch. This added to the film for me by investing me on an emotional level. However, I feel it shifts the Book of Henry to a young adult film. Parents should view it first and decide if they’re comfortable with the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost every scene did something interesting with the background. Attentive viewers get many gratifying moments with hidden jokes and subtle plot points. Some of my favorite moments were the hidden gems in the background, or even in the subtext of the character conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that sold me on the story was the acting. The cast here includes both Naomi Watts and Dean Norris. Both of the younger actors,  Jaeden Lieberher and  Jacob Tremblay, deliver when it counts. While their performances fall flat at times, the moments when they excel make up for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the use of sound and music impressed me. The Book of Henry makes effective use of these elements to heighten the emotions you feel. It can be a challenge to have the audio take on both personality when it’s the focus and also melt into the background when it’s supporting the action. Not only does it do that successfully, but noticeably so in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is easily going to be one of my favorite movies of the year. I loved the way the details fleshed out the story, how the story had the right amount of foreshadowing, the characters, the themes, and ideas. The Book of Henry is a must watch and a credit to everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/06/2017-06-08-colossal.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Colossal is good enough that what you’re expecting when you see it will affect how much you like it. I would have liked it a lot more if the movie hadn’t been over hyped before I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trailers make it look like a low end weird comedy, and that’s not what it is. Colossal is a dark science fiction exploration of dependency, depression, and abuse. You may feel disappointed if you were looking forward to what the trailers promised. However, it uses its material to explore some dark places so well, it’s easy to forgive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Colossal, Gloria (Anne Hathaway) is an out-of-work party girl forced to leave her life in New York City and move back home. Once home, she finds refuge with old friends who turn out to be enablers of her self destructive behavior. She discovers that a monster appears in Korea every day at the same time as she is stumbling home drunk and alone. It becomes increasingly plain that the monster is a physical manifestation of Gloria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where Colossal gets interesting is in the tangle of enablers. Their motivations range from mutual addiction all the way to deliberate emotional abuse. The absolute best moments are when things get dark, spiraling into uncomfortable power games. The monster stomping around Korea acts as a physical embodiment of their dysfunctional relationships. It gets used for more than that, though. The destruction of the monster becomes the focus of the actual conflict of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a metaphor, the monster is brilliant. It’s cool when you’re drunk, but when you sober up and realize how much damage you’ve done, it’s crippling. If you’re familiar with that feeling in any way, there are some moments here that will hit hard. It doesn’t work so much as a plot point, though, and Colossal stumbles whenever it does anything else. When the movie is trying to move forward, or solve its problems it feels like it doesn’t know where to go. It ends up feeling lost, and the resolution is disappointing after all the great setup. The conclusion is easily the weakest moment of the whole experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the monster isn’t the only thing the movie doesn’t know how to deal with. Characters outside of the core circle of enablers stumble around. Any time Gloria is interacting with her old boyfriend, etc, it just doesn’t feel right. It may be because the core of the movie works so well that these moments feel weak by comparison. Even so, it breaks the immersion a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason Sudeikis is the standout as the supporting role. Anne Hathaway is as wonderful as she always is, capturing the character, but Sudeikis goes to some dark places. Every actor holds up throughout the film, though, even in the weaker moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t even remember the music, which I consider a negative. A soundtrack should contribute to the story and heighten emotion, and it often felt generic or even flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disappointing resolution and unfocused side stories undermine an otherwise great story. A few other minor failures make the flaws glow a little more brightly. Colossal is a good movie that unfortunately falls short of greatness, and is well worth watching for what it does well. Go in with your expectations in check and you’ll find a lot of rewarding content.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/06/2017-06-04-wonder-woman.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Wonder Woman is the best movie to come out of the DC comic book universe since The Dark Knight Rises. Director Patty Jenkins has built something exceptionally good out of the story by Zach Snyder. While it has both great acting and well paced action, it was what Wonder Woman has to say that hit hardest. A few issues mar it, though, holding it from being a classic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pacing of the action steers away from that of previous DC films such as Man of Steel and Suicide Squad. It was very refreshing to have the fight sequences delivered in smaller chunks. Every action scene gets built up so that by the time it happens you are really craving it. When you finally hear that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw_o7XUX3fg&quot;&gt;heart pounding theme music&lt;/a&gt;, your blood rushes and you are ready for it. I wouldn’t have minded a little more of this. Given the overuse of action in previous DC disasters, the restraint is preferable. While the length of the action scenes are more bite-sized, the action itself is over the top. Diana (Wonder Woman’s name) smashes into buildings like a human ballistic missile, scales walls with her bare hands, and uses attacks that leave building sized craters in the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the previous DC films, Wonder Woman successfully tells a cohesive story. More than that, it tells a good story that has something to say. Set during World War I, Diana sets out from the island isolating the Amazons from the world of men. She begins her journey believing that gods of myth are responsible for the worldwide conflict. The film works the best when it plays with our expectations for this relatively normal setup. It goes so far as to suggest that people don’t need super villains to cause our problems. Even more cool, it suggests that violent conflict can’t solve the worst of those problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the narrative feels just a little long. I was a bit anxious for everything to wrap up by the time the end was approaching. Additionally, after the turn in the final act, the movie goes on to resolve its issues with a fist fight. It doesn’t feel bad at the time because everything else works, but it didn’t feel like the right resolution. I wish the close of the story had been more in keeping with the smarter themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that helps keep the movie feeling fresh and fun is Gal Gadot’s performance as Diana. She is like a cool breeze on a hot day, and every time she’s on screen it feels good. I honestly can’t tell though if she’s a great actress, or just perfect for the role. It’s hard to tell given the role itself and the direction. I can say for certain, though, that I’m excited to see her more often and am very much looking forward to finding out. I hope it’s more than just the role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other standouts include Danny Huston as Ludendorff and  David Thewlis as Sir Patrick. Danny clearly has a ton of fun with the role of the primary villain, and David lends the end a believable weight. Chris Pine is even getting more likeable for me. Between Star Trek: Beyond and Wonder Woman, he’s starting to grow on me. It may just be me, but it is feeling like he is starting to add personality to his roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A secondary villain, Doctor Poison (played by Elena Anaya), feels underused. It feels like there should have either been more of her, or less. Given the minor feeling of being over long, I lean toward less of her. That said, she has a few interesting moments that make me wish we could see a story where she is more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Wonder Woman ranks with some of the best superhero movies in recent years. It sets a great tone for the future of the DC universe and makes me just a little excited for the Justice League movie. That’s a film I’ve been dreading up until now. Filled with cool plays on your expectations, fun acting, and held together with a well told story, Wonder Woman is a fantastic watch that I highly recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/05/2017-05-25-baywatch.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;I didn’t enjoy Baywatch very much, but I may not be the target audience. I have never watched the original series, and I’m not a fan of low brow comedy, so take this review with a grain of salt. I’m definitely not who this film was intended for. Baywatch reminds me of a quote that has stuck with me: “You can’t make fun of a clown. If you point at its shoes and make fun of it for having big feet, you’re the idiot.” The story is bad, the characters are flat, and everything feels superficial, but… that feels like it’s the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baywatch is true to the original. It’s a convoluted cop flick based around lifeguards, which, as is pointed out frequently, are not cops. It jokes about the original even as it pays homage, with guest appearances from both David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson. I went in expecting to enjoy a pretty fun if shallow comedy, and it comes pretty close to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if it’s being true to the original though, its story isn’t silly enough. It’s at that spot between good, bad, and good bad. It was just bad enough to irritate me, but not bad enough to be funny bad. I think the problem may be that the premise of life guards fighting crime isn’t bad enough on its own. That’s probably why the original show did so well, they’re close enough to heroes that it makes a weird kind of sense for them to fight crime. It needs to be either a little more serious or a little less. It lands right in this dead zone for me where I’m bored and irritated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I did laugh a few times, and there are some good jokes sprinkled around. A lot can be forgiven of a movie that’s able to make me laugh, but about half the time it goes too far. Some of the gags are so disgusting they were painful to look at and I really wish I hadn’t seen them. Maybe if they’d been a little more tame I could have at least recommended this as a thin if mildly enjoyable comedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as it turned out, the good parts of Baywatch don’t outweigh the bad. No part of it is fantastic, and the story and gross humor undo all of the positive elements for me. Maybe don’t change the channel if an edited version of it is on TV, but I didn’t like it and don’t recommend watching it.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/05/2017-05-12-alien-covenant-2017.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Alien: Covenant is the product of director Ridley Scott adjusting to fan criticism. Specifically, the vocal backlash to Prometheus, a thoughtful but flawed Alien prequel. Where other directors might respond with a gun shy sequel, Ridley embraced it. While Prometheus avoids the xenomorph as out-dated, Covenant embraces it as relevant. It uses an intelligent story, beautiful acting, and visual style to deliver the Alien prequel we deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was on the edge of my seat through the entire film. Ridley Scott produced a blend of heady sci-fi, body horror, and psychological thriller. It’s difficult to discern if this is a less thought provoking work than we would have gotten if there had been a more positive reception to Prometheus. This is because Covenant doesn’t abandon these questions. It grasps on to a single one and focuses on it with force and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prometheus asked us to consider how we were made, why were we made, and does our maker love us or even care. Covenant asks if our maker is worth our love. It’s a question loaded with loathing for humanity and for the things we have built. If the answer is no, then none of the other questions matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, this could be Ridley’s response to the feedback about Prometheus. He asked us to think about who we are and where we come from, and in rejecting that, he then asks if we even care. Not maliciously or out of spite, but with the context of asking if we even should care. We’re absolved of having to care, but at the expense of the life of our creator. From there, it makes everything we’ve built stink of death, and it makes every character feel alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite aspect of the film might feel like a small thing. The story starts with a colony ship, and so every character on board is paired in a relationship. This detail means that every character is invested in one other character in the story. As lives are lost, the irrational behavior of the survivors feels believable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is undermined by rushed character development. Failing to fully develop the crew is the largest failure in the story telling and the film as a whole. Clocking in at 2 hours long, Covenant still feels rushed, and could have benefited from being about 30 minutes longer. The best way to experience this movie is to watch the viral video prologues before watching the movie:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
	&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XeMVrnYNwus&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
	&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EkXgRlRao5I&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these are fantastic short films that add context and character to Covenant. In the case of The Last Supper, the personality it adds to some of our main characters is essential and absent from the film itself. It’s nice that they exist and are widely available, but I can’t help but imagine a film that captures this humanity. It would definitely be a better film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the characters make decisions that feel dumb, but even this reflects the larger sin of poor character development. A feel for who they are allows you feel their helplessness. It enables you to understand their suddenly being alone after losing someone they have loved for years. Poor decisions can be understood through the eyes of pain and grief, but wo lose out if we don’t identify with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talented acting from a dedicated cast manages to make up for some of this, though. Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston, Billy Crudup, and Danny McBride all delve head first into the insanity of loss. Even clipped of meaningful introductions and without any time to breathe, they sell you on who they are. Their performances give the downward spiral of the last half of the film weight. The increasing emotional instability gives Covenant a feeling of psychological madness. The best part is that this element is unique to Covenant in the Alien franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another of the other places that impressed me was the style. Much of the great charm of the original Alien came from how deeply it embraced the art of H.R. Giger. Covenant thrills in it, and not only in the design of the alien, but in almost every set outside of the human ships. Covenant blends this with the breathtaking landscapes and vistas that were one of the best parts of Prometheus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all results in a chilling horror-thriller that is 40% Prometheus, 40% Alien, and 20% Psycho. There were moments where I was genuinely heartbroken and terrified. Alien: Covenant may be my favorite Alien film. Ridley Scott has given us an excellent entry in the franchise and a brilliant response to fan criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/05/2017-05-08-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-2017.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;I’m really happy to report that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a solid entry into the series. I don’t think anyone was worried about that, but if you were, you can put your fears aside. That said, this manages to differentiate itself from the original. The acting and structure are stronger, but the music and humor elements struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I would not say this is better or worse, the way that Guardians 2 approaches its actions scenes is different. Guardians 2 starts with baby Groot dancing to a musical number while a typical monster fight rages in the background. The fight is mostly blurred out, it’s your typical CGI action sequence that is almost boring at this point. However, with us focused on baby Groot dancing in front of it, we get a glimpse of something small in high focus. This is a great metaphor for the movie as a whole, it’s all about looking at what’s really happening despite explosions happening all around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works well, and Gunn uses this technique in most of the action sequences. I was very impressed with how it showed something clever and entertaining in each major set piece. These moments where Gunn looks at only a few characters, or focuses in on the edges of a scene show an appreciation for what is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, this is an action movie, and so many viewers may not get exactly  what they were expecting. Viewers who are looking for more gritty action sequences that focus on the moment to moment punches may not be as satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a plot perspective, Guardians 2 is far more character driven than the original. We get to explore the motivations of Peter Quill and his relationship with the Guardians. Yondu, played by Michael Rooker, easily gets the best character development. These two characters are the main focus, and their stories get told in parallel. As opposed to Guardians 1, where the opening and the ending were the weakest parts, Guardians 2 holds together better for these parts. It would not be unfair to say that it doesn’t feel like much happens at all during the middle except for character development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I prefer a more character driven work, and so for me this was a better film. It’s different, though. There are fans of the first movie who may prefer the way the original manages to keep a quicker pace. Those viewers will not be disappointed by what they get here, but there is definitely a counter argument that the original is superior. A lot of people will find themselves debating which they prefer and how much you appreciate a good character arc will be the most important factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of that is also because Volume 2 simply isn’t done as well in 2 places: music and comedy. The use of music in Guardians 1 was its core defining feature. So much so that it ended up being its greatest influence on the genre, resulting in films such as Suicide Squad. There’s a great track list here, but there isn’t a single song that stands out as the one you’re still humming when you leave the theater. In addition to that, the clips are shorter and don’t feel as essential to the scenes they are included in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the comedy feels a little forced. There are a lot of great laughs here, but there are times when Gunn sacrifices the flow of a scene for a joke. More than once I felt the physical humor was unrealistic enough that it broke my suspension of disbelief. It’s noticeable and definitely disruptive to the experience to have so much effort in the jokes, even if most of them are good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a solid hit that is most definitely worth watching. This is arguably better than the original, despite its flaws, it is an excellently constructed adventure story.  Out of the their rapidly expanding catalog, this one is going to be one to remember as Marvel at their best.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/04/2017-04-27-king-arthur-legend-of-the-sword-2017.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Before watching King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, I tried to learn why this story keeps getting remade. I did some research, but didn’t find anything definitive. After seeing Legend of the Sword, I at least understand why this movie got made. We’ll talk more about that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legend of the Sword is a problematic movie in interesting ways. It has a great cast and a fascinating mythology that could have blossomed in a longer format. A Netflix or HBO series might have given these elements room to breathe and be more memorable. In its current format the bad far outweighs the good. This is sad, though, because there’s more going on here that didn’t pan out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issues start right at the beginning with the writing. The narrative is too loose, and it never takes a moment to let you feel grounded. Director Guy Ritchie packs in too much and too fast from the very first scene. Plot lines and characters get dropped left and right. At no point does the director manage to tie it together into a coherent narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a divide between the first half of the movie and the second. Driven by dramatic narrative, this half has more to say than the second half. Guy Ritchie knows that story is the core of this half of the movie. You can see this is the case by how it treats the action scenes. They are clipped, skipped over, obscured, or blurred, letting the viewer know that they should be paying attention to what is happening around the action, not the action itself. I’m a huge fan of this technique. How you treat action is a large part of how you highlight what you feel is most important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some subtle things are happening in the opening. When I said I understand why the movie was made, it’s because there is an allegorical message. Legend of the Sword wants to be about standing up to unjust authoritarian regimes. Fights in the streets feel like modern day clashes between police and protesters. Soldiers pounding their shields, the background on fire, and riots in the street. That’s a pretty relevant story, or it would be if Legend of the Sword could deliver on any of those ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that sounds cool to you, I have to agree. Converting the story of King Arthur into a narrative of rebellion is a good idea. Unfortunately, this never pans out. The sense of might makes right, solving every problem with punching or stabbing causes these themes to crumble. Everything feels rushed and crammed together.  On top of that, we never get a picture of  the story because the plot jumps around so much. And that’s even before the second half starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jude Law manages to give the character of King Vortigern some depth. Tragically, Vortigern’s screen time is far too chopped. Many of his actions are unconvincing or downright confusing. This is emblematic of the entire film, good ideas thoroughly wasted by poor or incomplete execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Arthur confronts the villain, Legend of the Sword loses its purpose and direction. The entire plot of the people’s rebellion crashes to the side. With the way the movie ended, there’s no reason at all the film couldn’t have been an hour shorter. They smash their way through the front door in a way that will have any viewer asking themselves why that couldn’t have happened earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the final conflict breaks out, Legend of the Sword becomes nothing but a brawl. All sense of tension and storytelling are abandoned. Everything resolves through CGI animations of King Arthur murdering his way through the enemy. It’s so fake and devoid of suspense, or purpose, that I was bored. When the movie finally ends, it’s a relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some good ideas here along with impressive world building. There’s a menagerie of giant beasts and monsters that populate this world, but we never get to meet them. They smash in and out of our view with only a few moments each, often with little to no introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legend of the Sword has good ideas that are completely undermined by the story and editing. It’s not worth your time, it’s not worth your money. Give this one a pass.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/04/2017-04-14-more-movies-that-look-interesting.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;There are so many movies coming out soon that have fascinating trailers that I had to do this again. One list just wasn’t enough to cover it all. That said, this list is not an endorsement for these films.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these movies have a lot of warning signs, and could end up quite bad. I’ll be listing both the reason I find the movie exciting, and possible reasons it could go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;thor-ragnarok&quot;&gt;Thor Ragnarok&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good signs: Marvel feels like it’s unstoppable. Almost everything they touch is fun, playful, and entertaining. The trailer has a cool retro vibe, awesome sci fi elements, and Cate Blanchett killing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad signs: The last two Thor movies are among the lesser Marvel movies. Moreover, Marvel has to mess up sometime. If there’s a time it’s likely to happen, it may be now. Thor has been the weakest link in the film universe to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;sleight&quot;&gt;Sleight&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good signs: The trailer for Sleight is full of great tension and fascinating dialog. It has seen limited release and a lot of good buzz surrounds this low budget thriller. A selling point for the movie so far is that it shares a producer with this year’s Get Out, which was a breakout hit for horror fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad signs: When you look deeper into it, sharing a producer doesn’t mean anything at all.  WWE Studios and Blumhouse Productions picked up Sleight after the fact and had no hand in its creation. The marketing for this feels pretty manufactured, it’s a debut for the director, and the actors lack experience. These should leave viewers wary that the existing buzz may include bias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
	&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jOBAoSy4oJI &quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-hitmans-bodyguard&quot;&gt;The Hitman’s Bodyguard&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good signs: Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson together are highly likely to be fun no matter what. The trailer reflects this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad signs: It’s just a trailer. Trailers frequently fail to be representative of the film they are about. There doesn’t appear to be any real substance to this trailer.  Movies that try to coast by entirely on star power tend to be not so great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-bad-batch&quot;&gt;The Bad Batch&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good signs: Every movie that Keanu Reeves has been in lately has been a beautiful blend of action, story telling, and artistic vision. The rest of the cast also has a wonderfully eclectic film selection. Additionally, I cannot get enough post apocalyptic fiction, and The Bad Batch looks to cater to this very specific genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad signs: There doesn’t appear to be a lot of substance to the plot. This could end up being a pretty shallow experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;war-machine&quot;&gt;War Machine&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good signs: It’s Brad Pitt in an energetic quirky role and Netflix. We could see a great actor go wild with all the creative freedom we’ve seen from the likes of Kevin Spacey in House of Cards, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad signs: Netflix has absolutely proven they are fallible. Their catalog at this point is completely hit or miss and their brand is no guarantee of quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;dunkirk&quot;&gt;Dunkirk&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good signs: It’s Christopher Nolan. Nolan may well be the greatest director of our time, and everything he has touched has become a classic of modern cinema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad signs: More World War II. It’s nearly impossible for me to be excited for another story from World War II. I’ve been steeped in this setting for my entire adult life and I honestly need a few years away from it. This is unlikely to make it bad, but it makes it difficult for me to be excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-beguiled&quot;&gt;The Beguiled&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good signs: Rich in atmosphere and with a fascinating setting, The Beguiled has a cast that can really flourish. This looks like a tense and chilling thriller that could be a horror movie to remember. When a dark story like this works, it works in a way that you remember for life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad signs: It’s so easy for a film like this to dive off into empty gore and poor story telling. Every time I watch something like this it feels like a gamble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;deadpool-2&quot;&gt;Deadpool 2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good signs: We have every reason to believe, based on the trailer and the first movie, that Deadpool 2 will be a whirlwind of comedy and action. I’m looking forward to more genre subverting story telling and gags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad signs: There have already been shakeups in the production due to creative differences. Additionally, there is a much bigger budget at stake here. A lot of the original’s charm may well have been because of the limited budget and the sequel may not do well with fewer restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;free-fire&quot;&gt;Free Fire&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good signs: The trailer for Free Fire is filled with unique visual themes and fast paced action. There’s a good chance this could be a  refreshing take on modern action and gunplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad signs: This movie could easily have nothing else going for it, and not even do those things well either. All our hype for this one comes from what we’re seeing in the trailer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;atomic-blonde&quot;&gt;Atomic Blonde&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good signs: An awesome cast, with both great action and acting chops. The action in the trailers is intense and brutal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad signs: In a statement that is just feeling all too frequent, the majority of our hopes are based on the trailer. While the cast and style are promising, that’s all we have.&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/archive/2017/04/2017-04-11-going-in-style-2017.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Director Zach Braff’s Going in Style is a remake that no one asked for with a weak modernized slant. By changing the motivation of the characters, Braff may have created something satisfying. Instead, a few laughs and decent acting save an enjoyable, if hollow and unfulfilling film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going in Style (2017) differs itself from the original by embracing the setting of modern America. This is partly done by changing the motivations of the main characters. In the original, the protagonists become bank robbers out of a desire to feel alive and young. Here they are struggling and sick old men who are victims of modern banking and irresponsible business practices. All of them have had their pensions stolen. Moreover, Joe (Played by Michael Caine) is losing his house because of a variable rate mortgage from a predatory lender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Going in Style only uses this premise to justify bank robbery. It’s a tone deaf reversal of the few benefiting at the expense of the many. The weight and gravity of their problems are wildly out of sync with the narrative. Ultimately, the end result doesn’t fix any of the real problems that instigate the story. At the end of the film, Zach Braff seems to care more about encouraging kidney donations than he does about victims of a corrupt financial system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, is it bad? No. It’s easy to talk about what’s wrong, because I’d like to see more done with this material. This criticism is out of love for media that has something to say. If you can ignore the emptiness of the plot, there’s quite a lot of good here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competent directing, and amazing performances from an excellent cast do a lot to keep the film generally enjoyable. Christopher Lloyd was the stand out performance for me. He was responsible for the best laughs. Though the movie has a rather large list of great actors, few of them did any memorable work here. That’s not a bad thing though, as everyone on board is a great actor and doing average for them is still great acting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the writing fails to deliver a satisfying plot, it does deserve some credit. The dialog is solid, and it allows all of these great actors to shine from moment to moment and work together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this generally sounds harsh, it’s because I felt like there was enough here that we could have gotten something amazing.  It isn’t the only comedy that doesn’t have anything to say, and it wont be the last. Going in Style is an average but enjoyable heist movie with a good cast that delivers some great laughs.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/03/2017-03-30-ghost-in-the-shell-2017.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;The live action remake of Ghost in the Shell succeeds at capturing the visual style of the original, but drops the deeper ideas. This is an achievement in style and design that excels so well at visuals, acting, and pacing that most will be able to forgive that it has very little to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is not a single frame of this movie that lacks weight. It is one of the most meticulously constructed films that I have ever seen. Every shot contains enough visual information as to deserve thoughtful consideration. The style of the original is perfectly preserved, evoking a sense of world building that hasn’t been seen since Blade Runner. Both frightening and compelling, this new world is beautiful and ugly, spacious and oppressive. It’s visual success is a testament to the design of the original given how faithfully it recreates the look and feel of the anime it is based on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the acting here is particularly interesting. It isn’t outright good, exactly. What is fascinating is how the cast works to evoke the feel of the characters from the source material. It’s a display of tremendous skill and effort that may feel like a flaw. I found it compelling, and that direction worked to make the world feel more real. This was really important, because the world itself is the most important character. Many of the questions abandoned from the original can still be felt in design of the city itself. This dedication to recreating that style of movement bridges the gap between the original and the remake. It also ensures that audiences will remember this as a landmark work of gorgeous cyberpunk fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aggressively paced with a more cohesive vision, it’s fair to say that abandoning those deeper ideas improved the film. Director Rupert Sanders forces us to ask if a movie can be better despite having less to say. By cutting out the questions of identity that drive the original, the new Ghost in the Shell manages to be a more focused action film. Is that better, though? I don’t think so. Sadly, I feel that while this work will persevere as an important visual work, and as a memorable action film, that it is lesser than the original. By having less to say about how we define self and the nature of existence, it falls short. I would rather have a flawed movie that tried to say more, than a great movie with no voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Ghost in the Shell is an above average summer popcorn flick. It’s a landmark work of visual style will have it stand out for years to come, though it is difficult to let go of the feeling that it could have been more. Audiences who haven’t seen the original wont miss what they never had. Fans of the original will still be able to appreciate the incredible visual achievement. Though this could have been something really special, it is still a fantastic and enjoyable action film that I highly recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/03/2017-03-28-the-zookeepers-wife-2017.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Based on a true story, The Zookeeper’s Wife is not entirely without subtlety despite being a direct and straightforward story. There is merit in telling a touching story about real life perseverance in hardship. Unfortunately, this isn’t enough to carry an entire film. The Zookeeper’s Wife is visually compelling, but fumbles at building suspense and lacks a unique voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost every shot of this film is well composed, and the colors are clean and beautiful. The animals fill the length of the film with life and most of its beauty. Johan Heldenbergh delivers the most compelling performance in the film as the zookeeper. Jessica Chastain is solid, but lacks nuance as the lead in the film. She is good enough to hold the film together, but is a little flat when she needs to excel. Val Maloku plays their son, and is easily the weakest link in the film. More than one scene falls apart with him at the center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite parts of the film were the times when it said a lot with a little. Once or twice the film permits the audience to imagine what is happening, or asks of them to know what will happen. These scenes fill find a great deal of power in what they don’t show, or don’t say, and they are the strongest parts. They feel a little out of place, though, in a film that is otherwise very direct and straightforward. The main characters are never morally challenged. More importantly, the danger they’re in never feels more than perfunctory. Rarely did I ever feel worried for the fate of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, though, I don’t think The Zookeeper’s Wife has anything to add to the conversation. It’s content to be just a good story. And it is, that. This is a true story, an incredible one, and that’s the best part. I don’t think that’s enough, though. We have tons of great and incredible stories of heroism, loss, and tragedy from the holocaust. The very best of these stories have more to say, something deeper to look at. I didn’t get that here, and given the other weaknesses, I think it needed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, The Zookeeper’s Wife is a good movie that is worth watching despite its flaws. It will have little lasting impact or be worth multiple viewings, though it has its moments. If you enjoy drama and want a good story, it will scratch that itch.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/03/2017-03-26-interesting-upcoming-movies-summer-2017.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;This is a list of upcoming movies in 2017 that we’re excited about. Bear in mind that we have not seen these movies. Though these movies look interesting, it is very possible that they may be bad. Some of these have a high risk factor, so please do not take this list as an endorsement for these films. That said, these are the movies we are watching closely for in the upcoming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lego-ninjago&quot;&gt;Lego Ninjago&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An original Lego intellectual property, Ninjago is a weird beast. This made it onto my radar despite a lack of interest in the source material. After a strong trailer and Lego’s hot streak after both Lego Movie and The Lego Batman Movie, I want to know more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alien-covenant&quot;&gt;Alien: Covenant&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until a few months ago, I thought we’d see Neill Blomkamp’s Alien 5 before a sequel to Prometheus. The last I had heard, Ridley Scott was still in limbo, waiting on a good script to deliver a great follow up. When the trailer for this came out, it was a pleasant surprise that got me excited for several reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s exciting to see a Ridley Scott Alien movie that actually includes xenomorphs. The cast is outright interesting, including both Danny McBride and James Franco. Prometheus had mixed results, though, so beware.  Despite any hesitation one might have over the Ridley Scott’s follow up to Prometheus, it’s hard not to get excited by this trailer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;valerian-and-the-city-of-a-thousand-planets&quot;&gt;Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fifth Element has forever left a hole in my life for a special type of science fiction. We haven’t gotten anything that has scratched that itch since. Valerian has all the ingredients to be a beautiful spiritual successor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directed by the Fifth Element director Luc Besson and is an adaptation of the comic that inspired it. The trailer is loaded with style, action, and great music. For those who have waited for a movie that hits the same way as Fifth Element should keep their eyes open for this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blade-runner-2049&quot;&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harison Ford claimed that this was the best script he has ever read, and has returned to be in it. He is also joined by Ryan Gosling, who rocked 2016 with both The Nice Guys and La La Land. It’s hard not to feel excited by a new film in one of my favorite sci fi universes made by the original director, Ridley Scott.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the teaser trailer feels weak to me. I’m very much hyped about this movie despite the trailer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ghost-in-the-shell&quot;&gt;Ghost in the Shell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There just aren’t enough movies that address the concepts of transhumanism. A live action remake of one of the most groundbreaking works of anime, Ghost in the Shell has a lot to draw from. The source material provides a template, including pacing, style, and design to spare. It would be hard not to make something incredible with this source material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, translations are rarely ever done well. Not only that, but there is already a lot who are not happy with Scarlett Johansen as the lead. Most are unhappy with the idea of white washing. Personally, though, I just wonder if there are any other women in Hollywood who can get work as an action star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the trailer is awesome:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spiderman-homecoming&quot;&gt;Spiderman: Homecoming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part of Captain America: Civil War for me was Spiderman, without question. This was the most fun I have ever had watching Spiderman on film. I’m thrilled for a whole movie that explores this continuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even better, Marvel is now contributing to the production for Spiderman. It’s hard not to get excited over that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2&quot;&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, nuff said. If I have to pick a second reason, it’s to see baby Groot actually kick ass. There is a new trailer, though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are only a few of the films that are on my radar in the coming months. Given the strong entries we’ve already had this year, 2017 is shaping up to be an excellent year.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/03/2017-03-19-fist-fight-2017.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Fist Fight is an comedy that looks dumb but has not only brains and laughs, but something to say. The highest praise I can give it is to say that it is Fight Club Lite. If you’re a fan of dark comedy that has questions to ask, you should watch it. Director Richie Keen has delivered a layered story portrayed by fantastic actors. While it may falter at the end, the majority of the movie is so good that it is forgivable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leads for Fist Fight are well chosen. Ice Cube, as Strickland, is a force of nature, determined and unforgiving. Buying completely into the plot requires understanding Strickland’s motivations. There are enough cheap laughs here that Ice Cube didn’t need to sell us on that. This film could have coasted by on the cheap laughs, but it didn’t. The delivery of Ice Cube is so spot on, passionate, and thoughtful that it gives you pause. At the end I felt I understood what he represented. Ice Cube is always fun, but his dedication to this role is obvious and it elevates this movie in a way I didn’t expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a foil for Strickland is Charlie Day’s Andy Campbell, a reasonable man. He keeps his head down and focuses on the things that he feels are important in life: keeping his job, showing affection for his family, and not fighting. Like most adults with a family and job  trying to keep it together, he’ll do anything to avoid fighting. We’re thrust into this world through his point of view and we’re supposed to want what he wants. He wants to get through the day with his job, and without having to get in a fight. Similar to Ice Cube, Charlie Day is perfectly cast for this role. He brings a perfect balance of comedic timing, rationalism, and weaseliness to the role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so an unstoppable force meets an immovable object to the extreme that we begin ask a question. Should we avoid all conflict? Is there never a time when it’s appropriate to abandon our composure and throw down? The ending of the film fails to deliver on these themes. I think that’s because there was a need to have what felt like a happier ending. Whatever the reason, the movie doesn’t quite hit its themes . Yet, by the time we get to the end, the rest has been so much fun that it’s hard to feel disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of this thoughtful story line we experience a school gone mad, over run with insane and out of control students. It’s like the cover of a mad magazine. The absurdist surface contrasts the philosophy lurking under the surface. It feels like Rick and Morty in how it delivers thoughtful narrative under the guise of dick and fart jokes. And the great casting doesn’t stop with the leads. Every single actor here brought the goods. Filled with the likes of Jillian Bell, Christina Hendricks, Tracy Morgan, Kumail Nanjiani, and more, the comedy in the foreground of the story is firing on all cylinders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite failing to deliver on its themes at the end, Fist Fight is a well made and funny movie. The acting is fun and it is capable of provoking thought. If it had stuck to its guns, I would have considered it to be a classic. As it is, I still recommend giving it a watch.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/03/2017-03-12-john-wick-chapter-2-2017.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;John Wick: Chapter 2 is going to be a divisive work, partly because it’s a good sequel. How you receive this film will depend a lot on what you were looking for in a followup. Fans looking for more of the clever, fast paced, and brutal action of John Wick will get that. Those excited about the mythology will find a breadth of new world building. Chapter 2 will disappoint those, like me, looking for a story with something to say, but not because it isn’t good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first two types of viewers, you don’t need to read more. The movie gives you exactly what you want and more. The action is frantic and visceral. There are creative over the top encounters in unique and visually striking locations. The universe gets substantial depth and expansion. The Hotel introduces new rules, and the powers that move the world gain personality. If either of those things was all you wanted, then go see this movie. This movie was so satisfying on those levels that the entire theater I watched it with sat silent for the full duration of the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the those to whom felt that the story was important, keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a pretty well circulated opinion that John Wick doesn’t have very much to say. Advocates of this idea feel that the core value of the original is the well executed visceral action. I do not agree with this. A depth of intelligence and thoughtfulness dwells beneath the surface of this franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Wick’s characters, narrative, and world building suggest a playful wit. The action flourishes with a wink and a nod as it implies that it doesn’t matter what the story is about. This is because at its heart, the idea of the story is that John has an incurable lust for violence. The gag of the first movie is about how thin the plot is, but that’s also part of its soul. Killing so many people over the personal wrongs done are deeply damaging to society. It’s a sophomoric indulgence in the fantastical revenge that many wish for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main purpose for Chapter 2 seems to be to remove any remaining sense of reason for John’s actions. Everything he does gets robbed of meaning from beginning to end. He gets everything he wants, but in a way that makes it feel like ash in the mouth of the viewer. Every important kill in the movie robs us of satisfaction from the event. To discuss this further would spoil the story, so I can’t go beyond that. By the end of the movie, though, I felt as though the plot had gone in a terrible circle. It ends right where it begins, on the precipice of more terrible escalating violence and no way out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the story unfolds, the central plot to the film mirrors itself in scene after scene. It’s so purposeful that I have to give the film credit for being deliberately disappointing. Since the first movie did imply that the violence was empty, there is a question of whether or not it was necessary to re-emphasize this. For the thoughtful viewer, we’re shown how empty what we’re being provided with is all over again. Chapter 2 does this so much better than the origninal, though, that it is palpably haunting to experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those paying attention to the original John Wick would notice the same themes. Chapter 2 goes so far with them that it robs the experience of satisfaction. This is going to bother viewers, but after digesting it for a while, I realize I liked it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Wick is the type of movie I worried about a sequel for. I didn’t want more of the same. What made the original so great was that there aren’t a lot of movies like it. Especially ones that are also well thought out. Be prepared to feel let down if you’re that type of viewer. But in a way that makes you think more about what you’ve watched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Wick: Chapter 2 is a fascinating film that satisfies on multiple levels. You may be one of the viewers who feels hollow after watching it. But there are some kinds of emptiness that stick with you and make you keep thinking about what you’ve just experienced. That’s a type of vaccuum I can live with.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/03/2017-03-08-kong-skull-island-2017.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;I am impressed by Kong: Skull Island, both as an adventure film, and a film that uses themes to move the plot. This genre has had some pretty lazy entries lately, but Skull Island changes that. The story, acting, and directing are all thrilling and smart, and they’re backed by great music. Even the monster battles feel well paced and advance the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll set the plot aside for now and go down the checklist of what Skull Island has going for it. It’s got a well rounded cast of actors who have both range and screen presence. These aren’t career defining performances, but there is not a single weak link in the chain. The real head turners here are John C. Reilly and Samuel L. Jackson. Even in a fairly average performance, Jackson is a compelling foil to pit face to face against King Kong. His imposing stage presence is perfect for the role, even for an average performance for him. John C. Reilly nails the comic relief for the movie. He is always a joy to find, though a lot of his jokes were in the trailers, his comedy still landed with excellent timing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skull Island uses the recent trick of loading up the movie with classic rock songs. The type of music that you’re guaranteed to love no matter what the quality of the movie. Musically, the film is very formulaic. You’ve heard all of these songs before, and in the exact same way, so there’s nothing new here. It’s the weakest part of the film, but it’s also not bad. The songs are used sparingly to move to set the tone and move the opening forward. Then, after the plot moves to the foreground of the movie the classic rock fades to the background a bit. This lets the movie breathe and keeps it from feeling like a bunch of trailers spliced together. That’s the most common pitfall with that technique and Kong avoids it with grace, even if it isn’t new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most viewers will be more interested in the action than the story. Fear not, it’s well paced, aggressive, and it never drags the film. All of the encounters feel meaningful, and do not upset the pacing. Not only that, but there are a lot of them. They are well spread throughout the experience, and help push the story along. This is something that a lot of similar movies fail at. By not balancing the ups and downs of the film, it’s easy to make a movie boring by not controlling the highs and lows. The level of competency demonstrated at controlling the pacing is downright masterful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the story is fantastic. Setting the movie during the Vietnam war is purposeful. It serves to create a lens by which we can see the difficulty of understanding long standing foreign conflicts from a limited point of view. The metaphor is pretty strong, and Skull Island reinforces it throughout its run time. It never hits the audience over the head with what it has to say, but there is definitively a well thought out and delivered philosophy. Viewers who enjoy a more complex experience to digest will find that here as well. It all results in a well rounded film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest criticisms are really that the movie falls on formula too often to feel genre defining. It’s a great movie, and audiences will love it, but it is missing a little something that pushes it above and beyond. That is hardly a criticism, though. I highly recommend Kong: Skull Island. It’s an awesome monster movie and also just a good action movie in general.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/02/2017-02-07-lego-batman-2017.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;The Lego Batman Movie is a blast, if not as well refined and pure as The Lego Movie was. It also lacks the surprise factor. After The Lego Movie, I was more prepared for this to be a clever insight into the character of Batman. To sum  up: this movie is insightful, funny, and playful with its subject. So much so, that overcomes a few pacing and plot issues in a way that feels effortless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is smart enough to hold the attention of older audiences and still be attractive to children. What I found to be great here, was that this movie gets Batman. It addressed many of the concerns that Batman fans have been expressing for years. It cuts to the core of his problems as a hero: using his power and influence to beat people up as therapy rather than invest in fixing society. It’s clever and it’s funny, even though it pulls back and returns to a more traditional movie with a family friendly ending after the first half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every other Batman film is a brooding afair that is dismissive of the life of Bruce Wayne. They have &lt;a data-toggle=&quot;modal&quot; data-target=&quot;#secretcomic&quot;&gt;glutonously indulges in the loss of his parents&lt;/a&gt; for years. Lego Batman moves on and works on his future. The writers here also get, and make fun of, the flaws of Batman as a character. This is something that I particularly loved, and had me laughing constantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acting and music are spot on. Will Arnett reprises his role as Batman, and gets to work again with Michael Cera (Playing his adopted son). The chemistry here works. More over, I have to say that we finally got the Two Face we deserved: Billy Dee Williams. I have always wished that the Batman franchise had stuck to its guns and let him go from Harvey Dent to two face. He’s got great timing and good acting chops, and I love it every time I see him on film. The only shame is that the film is so crowded with character that we only get a few brief seconds with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few flaws do mar the experience. The pacing of the last half stumbles and lacks the clever on point storytelling of the first half. The vast array of characters comes at a price, too. While the leads are all very well acted, many of the background characters are disposable. Their lackluster casting is minor, but noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, I still have to say, there are moments in this movie that made me laugh harder than I’ve laughed in years. Humor is subjective, though, and that’s why I mention it last. The steady stream of in jokes, references, digs at Batman as a hero and as an icon landed effectively for me. They also came with nods and winks to fans of a wide variety of fandoms, like Doctor Who and Lord of the Rings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend The Lego Batman Movie. It was a blast and I enjoyed the ride thoroughly. The few flaws wont bother the majority of viewers, though it may wear thin after repeated viewings.&lt;/p&gt;

","_posts/archive/2017/02/2017-02-04-rogue-one-2016.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Rogue One is a pretty interesting movie, and I want to start by saying that I liked it. The reason I feel it’s really important to start with that is that it’s a flawed work and it’s really easy to talk about what’s wrong with it. But, I want to make it very clear that I felt the good outweighed the bad and I enjoyed it &lt;em&gt;thoroughly&lt;/em&gt;. The story is fun sci fi cheese that has relatively normal people reaching for something that they believe in and making sacrifices for it. To me, that makes for an engaging story despite any flaws. The music is excellent, the action is fun, and I was attached to the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I found interesting about it was that it was affected by what appear to have been extensive re-writes and reshoots. The broken development shines through in the action scenes and story cohesiveness, and it’s palpable. Characters and story-lines are dropped left and right. They are too much and too little. They’re just enough to make you wonder what’s missing, and if they were cut completely they may not have been missed at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characters will show up and and disappear or choose to die without having done much of anything and for no particular reason. The plot jumps from place to place, but doesn’t make many of them feel important or necessary, with very little accomplished. The bigger issues lay in the inconsistancies of the  main characters. They shift from morally gray to doing the right thing without really a reason or character change to explain it. Many of the action scenes feel loose, and poorly thought out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, what is good with this movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time I watched it. I had to watch it a second time before it started falling apart for me. I was invested in what was happening, and it didn’t matter that I knew that the rebels got the plans. I cared about what was happening and the fate of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also give a lot of bonus points for what I feel is a surprising ending. I have heard a lot of people say it is predictable, but I have to completely disagree. Without giving away spoilers, “safe movies”, movies that do not take many risks and are largely made by committee… they don’t end like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Force Awakens didn’t work for me because all of the character felt too overpowered and like they didn’t ever have to risk or lose anything. Rogue One: A Star Wars story feels like all the characters and everything they believe in is on the line, and that’s the huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can turn off your brain and see past the flaws, there is a real gem that I think will be a classic for generations.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/02/2017-02-02-the-space-between-us-2017.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Had &lt;em&gt;The Space Between Us&lt;/em&gt; built a cohesive story it may have been watchable. A reliance on incoherent coincidence, cheesy jokes, and generic teen drama undermine the good. What’s left is a story that may not offend audiences, but will bore them by halfway through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A teen drama about a young man raised in secret on mars who journeys to earth for love. Along the way he discovers the beauty of a world denied to him. His core drives are to find love in his long distance pen pal, and to find his father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/2016/11/the-space-between-us-2016/space-between-us-mars.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial hope that Gary Oldman would put on a fun enough performance to keep me entertained was quickly dashed. By halfway through I was just glad that he looked as bored as I was. It’s a rare to see anything from Gary Oldman fall flat, but he just can’t pump any life into this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it sad that Oldman was the best of the actors. Asa Butterfield, as Gardner Elliot, does deliver one or two moments of genuine emotion. He makes us pay for it with his lows, though. Every other performance detracts from from the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equal blame belongs to the writing. The dialog must take as much for the credit for these performances as the actors themselves. Throwaway responses and contrived exposition comprise half of anything anyone has to say. If you are spending half your dialog apologizing for plot holes, there’s a real problem here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acting and dialog issues are second to the broken narrative. Predictable at best, and at worst it uses cheap and implausible solutions to get to where it wants to go. Careless resolutions to core elements of the story undermine my investment. And that’s when the movie bothers to address a plot hole. Some gaps are just left open and weeping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/2016/11/the-space-between-us-2016/about-as-good-as-it-gets.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unfortunate mess remains after everything gets tied together. The tragedy here is that these themes deserve better. Exploring the wonderful aspects of life on Earth from that outside perspective can work. These ideas could even be profound and impacting, but the sub-par delivery ruins it. Worse, these great ideas become boring in the telling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few good ideas lost in the troubled narrative aren’t the only high points. As mentioned before, Asa Butterfield does manage to land a few good moments. The director, Peter Chelsom, composes some frames that are inspiring. Though few and far between, these are intriguing and engaging in their composition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could have gotten something better. &lt;em&gt;The Space Between Us&lt;/em&gt; has a wealth of great ingredients, but they’re all put together wrong. Not even bad enough to offend, it wont be worth turning the channel if you catch it on late night TV. We’re left with a snooze fest that is all downhill after the opening monologue.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2017/01/2017-01-07-a-monster-calls-2016.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;I appreciate it when a movie finds a new facet of its subject matter, giving me something extra to consider. A Monster Calls does this with subtlety. The narrative and world building are the strongest elements. I also reveled in the stylized art during the fantasy sequences. The rest of the movie is just good enough to let those breathe, though there is some room to nitpick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be difficult to see past your emotions when a movie pulls at your heart strings. The story follows the path of a boy who struggles with the very real difficulties of having a parent diagnosed with cancer. While watching it, the sobs in the theater were audible, and not just my own. What I liked most is that this wasn’t the whole of the story, just the jumping off part. Moreover, it’s never outright said. We get this delivered through subtext and visuals rather than stilted exposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what does the movie jump off to from this point? Conor (portrayed by Lewis MacDougall) is who we experience the movie with. At age 12 he lives with his mother who is sick, and receiving treatments that make her worse and better. His estranged father lives in the United States. His grandmother inserts herself into the their life with increasing frequency. On top of that, he experiences regular and aggressive bullying at school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this is set up, Conor meets the monster and begins to act out at home and at school. His behavior continues to escalate as he works through is pain. Each outburst worse than the last, all without the satisfaction he is looking for. A release from the pain, the guilt, and feeling like he doesn’t belong anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the story of A Monster Calls begins to grow beyond its not uncommon starting point. Every aspect of the story grows around exploring Conor’s feelings and behavior. This movie is about coping with loss from a confusing and isolated place. We follow Conor through his stages with grief as he learns to accept his circumstance and live with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monster, voiced by Liam Neeson, is Conor’s guide through his grief. Through a series of stories that prompt a more complicated world view, he forces Conor to admit how he feels. It’s heartbreaking stuff that got to me more than once. It’s rare to see a deconstruction of the process of grief that comes from such a personal space and it worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parallel to the mundane, the stories of the monster are like water color paintings come to life. This fantastical element keeps you at a distance before the epilogues subvert your expectations. The 3d used to animate them has a flawed execution. Each stumbles a bit from the half and half medium of 3d used to illustrate paintings. I suspect it was a budget limitation, but it diminishes the effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on, because I believe there is a lot of worthwhile discussion surrounding the story. Unfortunately, going further requires spoilers, so I’ll move on to the technical execution. Lewis MacDougall sells it. His performance works, and it’s the most important in the film. Felicity Jones is more than good enough for her limited screen time as the mother. Sigourney Weaver succeeds at conveying her emotion, but her accent is distracting. I couldn’t say if it is because I’m too used to her in other roles, or because it is out of place, but it broke the illusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liam Neeson’s performance is quite good, even through voice over. There were some great background touches that made the use of his voice extra effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only other nitpick would be that the music was forgettable. It was never bad, but it didn’t stick with me at all. I can’t think of a single moment where it took the stage and shined, or felt essential. In a movie where everything else comes together so well, being mediocre is holding the film back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend A Monster Calls. Though heartbreaking, this movie is going to stick with me as a beautiful exploration of loss. It may be too heavy for the audience it appeals to most, but it is definitely worth watching. Just be sure to bring tissues. For real. The feels are genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/12/2016-12-31-the-dilemma-of-passengers.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Passengers is a science fiction film that is straightforward in nature. The ethical questions the characters face are more interesting than the story. The plot reveals itself in a utilitarian fashion with few characters. Its core interest is in just a small number of their decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not fair to do a simple review of Passengers, as its quality ties into the discussion of the core story. So we’re going to dive into the whole thing, discussing every facet of the plot. That said, spoiler warning. This discussion involves plot points which are essential to the tone of the film and are not in the trailers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I give tons of bonus points for a film having a story that I didn’t see coming. A good surprise that the trailer hides, even one that’s revealed early in the film, is a tremendous plus for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it helps, I feel the movie is worth watching. The  music, visuals, and acting are all on point. A few issues with the plot detract from the larger experience and may bother some more than they bothered me. I believe it opens up room for a lot of discussion, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Spoiler Warning: Do not read further if you do not want major elements of the plot spoiled for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone here want spoilers? Okay, cool. Lets move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big secret here is that Passengers is not a romance movie. Though advertised as one, what we get is something grim. Jim Preston (played by Chris Pratt) wakes up alone, with 90 years left of a 120 year journey to a new world. Trapped on this ship, Jim starts by looking for ways to return to hibernation. He then attempts to wake the crew, call home, and identify what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With no productive results, he moves on. Left with no recourse, he changes his goal to enjoying the amenities of the ship. He drinks at the bar, he goes on walks outside of the ship, and otherwise enjoys his trip. However, the solitude, and the death sentence weigh on him and he becomes suicidal. Jim contemplates flushing himself out of the airlock before discovering Aurora.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aurora Lane (portrayed by Jenifer Lawrence) is a reporter on a two way trip. When Jim discovers her, he contemplates waking her up as he obsesses over her and her writing. And this is where things get weird. He picks her as his ideal mate, wakes her up, lets her  believe that her pod experienced a malfunction. He lets her wrestle with the reality that she will now die, all but alone, then begins to romance her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This moral fracture  relegates the initial malfunction and saving the ship to a subplot. To its credit, the movie treats what Jim does as wrong. It’s communicated via the dialog that he is aware of the consequences of his actions. Had Passengers ignored this a good deal of its audience may have overlooked it. Granted, it would have been a bland and straightforward affair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had it ignored and not brought this issue up, it wouldn’t be the first film to miss moral flaws. Movies frequently reflect the moral lens that they’re made through and absolve moral failures. The Little Mermaid teaches us that it’s okay to change who you are and give up your identity for love. Superman &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/1phidBmoNcY?t=1m34s&quot; title=&quot;Superman attempts murder.&quot;&gt;throws a barbell on a guy’s neck for being a jerk in a gym&lt;/a&gt; and is still the hero. Glossing over horrendous crimes is the bread and butter of Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He objectifies and condemns a human being to a solitary death, robbing her of a meaningful impact on society. This crime is what adds a complex nuance to the film. It’s why I give lots of credit for even considering it, given how often film ignores similar issues. Without this plot, there isn’t much happening here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when exploring this idea, there are two key aspects to it. There’s the position the movie says it has, and how it condones or condemns that position with action. It says it’s wrong, and what he does is monstrous. It’s acknowledged before and after the event by every character as being wrong. But then, the movie says that a drowning man is in extraneous circumstances. And Aurora forgives and embraces Jim, choosing to live with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re all drowning. Every last one of us is struggling in some way. We have our conflicts of body, mind, and spirit. I’m not happy with the answer that we should get what we want just because we were drowning. So I feel the need to specify that I disagree with the conclusion of Passengers. I feel that this issue is still viewed through the lens of an apologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we’re given this mixed message. We’re told both that taking away the agency of another being is wrong, but that it’s forgivable. There’s a reasonable argument that this is the definition of a violent crime. He’s robbed Aurora of her agency and personal choice. He does it with deliberate consideration in a pre-meditated fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Passengers fails to address the complex emotional responses to kidnapping. It treats her character arc as one of romance. The plot completely ignores the vulnerable emotional state in which she is making decisions. It ignores the subtlety of her beginning to identify with her captor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, I’m incredibly unhappy with where Passengers goes. After exploring these issues, I wish there were someplace better it could have ended up. All that said and done, though, I do appreciate that it’s viewed at all. If people talk about this, and issues like this, we can get better media. And for that, I give Passengers a lot of credit. I do recommend it, and I recommend talking about it. People should be talking about the ethics of the actions of our protagonists. It would be nice if more movies addressed them appropriately, but… baby steps.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/12/2016-12-19-collateral-beauty-2016.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;The term collateral damage is commonplace. We are familiar with the horrors that it alludes to. The concept of Collateral Beauty made me want a taste of what those words could deliver. The heart of this movie comes from a place of detached appreciation. It attempts to deliver a clinical exploration of pain  and loss, but stumbles. As such, the title comes from that same place… it appeals to where the head meets the heart and tries to heal something terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These themes get communicated by the opening of the film. The credits start with a sterile white space divided by shadow, hinting at the face of a clock. The key actors in this story are intelligent and charismatic advertising gurus. Their vision of what’s important to all people is clean and simple: time, love, and death. Every idea in this movie gets unpacked through those core needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting a glimpse of the main characters at their best, we jump immediately to their time of crisis. Howard, played by Will Smith, has been suffering from crippling depression since the death of his daughter. He’s drowning from it, and he’s pulling everyone down with him. Completely paralyzed by grief, he wont work with or for his friends and partners. As a result, their firm is collapsing and cannot be saved without his consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, we work through Howard’s pain, using it as a lens for the present day pain and suffering of his friends. It’s a meticulous and abstract way to approach life crushing grief and emotional paralysis. It works, though, and it works well. The verbal articulation of loss, and to respond in kind with the voice of time, love, and death. I found myself very surprised at how warm and human the pain felt despite the abstract and methodical approach to the subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything here is about breaking this tremendous amount of hurting apart, but without diving into it. Break it down first by how it affects you, what you want that you’ve lost. Then it approaches why you can’t move forward. And it’s all about trying to see the secondary effects radiate out from the central point of loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how Collateral Beauty struggles to internalize that pain without being trite, and primarily succeeds. It touches on something real and painful with cathartic results. The tears aren’t just from sadness, but from absorbing and learning to live with pain. That’s a great achievement for a film in which you never get to meet the character who was lost. Howard’s daughter is felt entirely through her absence in the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acting is top notch. Will Smith has been faltering lately, but this is a real return to form. Every action he takes forcefully conveys the pain that Howard is experiencing. While he is the standout here, Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, and Michael Peña all knock it out of the park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Frankel’s directing reflected the nuanced approach to Collateral Beauty’s ideas about mourning. Right from the opening credits, the film’s messages were immediately conveyed through the camera lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pitfalls in Collateral beauty come from trying too hard to be surprising. It works well for the first half, but when it comes time to wrap everything up we go through a whole new set of twists and turns that don’t work as well. This results in a muddy closing act, which wouldn’t be noticeable if the rest of the film weren’t so focused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie is so good at its best that these issues aren’t enough to undermine the emotional punches. But they do soften the blows and hold the movie back from something greater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the few issues with the final act, Collateral Beauty is easy to recommend. It’s an excellent approach to dealing with pain, and the feels are definitely real. The externalization of those internal feelings of loss is something that is rarely done this well and it hits where it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/12/2016-12-15-la-la-land-2016.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;There is a very short list of movies in which every single element ties together to reinforce what the movie is about. I don’t mean the plot, either. When you stand back and look at what the movie says, it hits hard and clear. At the same time, it’s like inception, though. If it spells it out for you, if it just writes it down, and you read it, it doesn’t work. The movie has to weave it into every fiber of the fabric of its existence. La La Land does this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La La Land is the story of two people balancing their dreams and passions against their ability to connect. Their search for meaning against the demands of life states that life is music. Specifically, life is jazz. It’s conflict and resolution; musicians making something new every time you hear it. The affecting soundtrack, natural dialog, and metaphorical directing to deliver its message beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melodies recur throughout the feature in different patterns and arrangements. Common themes rise and fall with the story. They could stand on their own and you would know what is happening. Not because this is a musical, either. The music does more than highlight the themes, mood, and story. It tickled something inside me. A half forgotten tune buried where only my soul remembered it. The track City of Stars in particular haunted me long after I left the theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the music is good enough to stand on its own, the writing jumps at you. Every word from both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone feels honest and genuine, as though it comes from a place of truth. When they break into song, it feels as natural as any verbal exchange I’ve ever heard. That is rare for me, as musicals feel jarring in their transition from dialog to singing. Here it felt as natural as breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What stood out to me, though, was the directing. The composition blends together music, dialog, and even the physical space to communicate. Metaphors weave into every frame, tied together by the dialog and cinched tight by the music. It blew my mind when I realized that even the sound effects were being used to drive home what I was watching. Every whisper of background noise is part of the composition. Every piece of furniture is an essential piece of how you feel about the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s about more than how the scene construction is. The writer and director, Damien Chazelle, is playful in his use of light, shadow, and color. He isolates figures with grace, illuminates the plot with skill, and plays with a look and feel that is a breathtaking gust of fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to level any criticism at La La Land, it would be at the pieces of music that lack clarity and a memorable rhythm. Also, a few bits of dialog rely on direct exposition to setup background for the characters. These are minor. They may be intentional incorporation of aspects of jazz, but they’re there. I almost want to apologize for noticing these imperfections, and imagine them as part of the artistry that completes the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, La La Land is a near perfect movie. It will last for decades to come as an example of what the medium is capable of. It touched my heart and woke up everything inside of me that makes me human. It reached me with laughter, love, and even a tinge of sadness. La La Land is a must watch.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/11/2016-11-08-arrival-2016.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;There is no shortage of movies attempting to divine what our first contact will be like. Classic examples include &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Day the Earth Stood Still&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;. It is something we have been imagining since we first imagined we are not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science fiction should prod us to ask new questions and see the world in new ways. It should challenge writers and directors to bring something new to the table. This is a task of increasing difficulty when using a well worn narrative template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/2016/11/arrival-2016/arrival-2016-screen2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is, does &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt; bring anything new to the table? The answer is a resounding yes. Director Denis Villeneuve uses first contact as a lens to reflect on who we are and how we work. Meticulous direction, thoughtful writing, and emotional acting deliver a profound experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pacing and direction stand out as the best part of &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt;. Denis Villeneuve takes full advantage of every frame to build narrative. The core challenge of the protagonists is simple: how do we communicate? The directing and writing work together to make this personal. Beyond asking how do we communicate with aliens, but how do we communicate with each other?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When all the pieces become revealed, everything gets turned around. The structure of the story telling changes the direction of the questions we ask. It shifts from what we ask the aliens to how we perceive ourselves. To talk more about the answers that &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt; provides would spoil it, and they are worth the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/2016/11/arrival-2016/them-arrival.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the directing, the visuals are not just beautiful, they are powerful. We feel the scale and weight of every scene and event. The ships aren’t eye candy, they’re inspiring works of art. The visitors are more than just believable graphically, they’re alien, and uncomfortable. Even when we are simply looking at people, their emotions are clearly conveyed in ever aspect of the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The directing also builds on top of the unique ideas of the writing. For all the credit for delivering the story, the writing itself starts strong. Exposition can kill a promising story, but here it feels natural. &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt; provides context for what the audience needs to understand without pausing. This results in a thinner view of denser science, but with richer narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the acting is top notch. Amy Adams lands difficult emotional nuance, and is a joy to watch. She conveys the complete range of human emotion without breaking a sweat. Jeremy Renner is  dry enough for a supporting role, but charismatic and engaging. I have never seen Forest Whitaker give a weak performance. He doesn’t steal scenes, he doesn’t undersell his character, he is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/2016/11/arrival-2016/amy-adams-jeremy-renner-arrival-2016.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weakest link may be the music. It’s grand, heart pumping, and alien, but it feels like a rework of previous movies. Tons of base and strong emotional peaks, but not enough individuality or personality. Is it bad? Not in the least. I’m reaching for what I observed that could be better. That said, this wont at all be a detractor for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt; is an incredible film, thoughtful and provocative science fiction, and beautiful art. It is a must see for the year, for all movie goers. Those who watch this will remember it for decades to come as a classic.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/11/2016-11-03-hacksaw-ridge-2016.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hacksaw Ridge&lt;/em&gt; is both brutal and breathtaking. Mel Gibson has captured a miracle on film with downright outstanding performances. Only a few flaws prevent this film from being the best war movie I have ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrative depicts the true story of Pfc. Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield).  We follow Desmond as he joins the army and goes to war. He follows his convictions to contribute to the war, while refusing to bear arms during World War II. The broad strokes are true, and the writing depicts the challenges of his path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any movie that can make me feel an emotion writhe within my chest makes the list of movies I will always remember. Even the actors who are already great have turned in career highlighting work. Hugo Weaving’s delivery contained enough passion that it made me laugh and cry at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/hacksaw-ridge-2016/to-war.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No other character is as completely transformed as Hugo Weaving. They do each contribute something special and necessary. Vince Vaughn has the charisma and wit to challenge R. Lee Ermey’s Gny. Sgt. Hartman as the definitive drill sergeant. It his funniest role in years. I laughed far more than I expected to at his spot on comedic timing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest surprise of the cast is Andrew Garfield. I never expected Garfield to be able to make me feel anything, especially in such a forced dramatic role. It works, though. Though weaker than the rest of the cast, he holds it together. When you need to believe in Garfield’s delivery, he makes it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am impressed with Mel Gibson’s directing. Part of what makes &lt;em&gt;Hacksaw Ridge&lt;/em&gt; work so well is how he has divided it. By separating the story of the path to war from the events of the battle itself, the narrative has room to breathe. Each segment has the opportunity to hit home in its own way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/hacksaw-ridge-2016/hacksaw-ridge-cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While both halves of the movie are excellent, the latter half stands as the more moving and honest. Though it would not have the weight that it does without the setup, the war is as brutal as anything I have ever seen. Stomach churning and suspenseful, the viewer feels pinned down with the soldiers. Gibson transports us from the warmth of home to the worst of battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only wish the pacing were better. While both halves of the story are necessary, they don’t feel unified. This is jarring and it breaks the flow. It feels like two whole movies glued together at a clear and distinguishable seam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/hacksaw-ridge-2016/the-metaphor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other problem that undermined my enjoyment of the film was the ending. &lt;em&gt;Hacksaw Ridge&lt;/em&gt; deserves a better ending. The last ten  minutes of the film tacks on a generic action film ending to what is otherwise a masterpiece. This undercut my appreciation for the greater accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I still cannot recommend this film enough. Sad, funny, scary, and warm, it spans the full range of human emotion. &lt;em&gt;Hacksaw Ridge&lt;/em&gt; evokes memories of the best war movies ever made, but falls shy of matching them. This may be the best movie this year.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/11/2016-11-01-5-movies-that-made-action-scenes-boring.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;It’s an amazing talent to be able to take the part of a movie that by definition should be exciting and engaging, then make it a boring chore to sit through. There are some directors that have made an absolute art form out of doing so. So how do they do it, you may ask?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way is to pause the movie for an over long period of time without progressing the plot. Our culture is so saturated with amazing action films that even die hard adrenaline junkie doesn’t need to sacrifice narrative to enjoy their explosions and punching. In fact, involving story lines create the stakes that make a good conflict so enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you pause your movie for what is tantamount to punching porn, there’s a special circle of hell reserved for you. Here’s a list of 5 egregious examples of movies that managed to make action scenes the most boring part of their entire movie. In order based on which action sequence did the greatest damage to the film or franchise as a whole:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/directors-who-made-action-films-boring/King-Kong-Peter-Jackson.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-king-kong-2005&quot;&gt;5. &lt;em&gt;King Kong (2005)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Jackson’s 3 hour long remake of King Kong is considered to be a successful film, currently sitting at a Rotten Tomatoes score of 84%. With fantastic acting, a beautiful rendition of a classic tale, and breathtaking cinematography, criticism for this film is thin and hard to come by. Few will argue, however, that it was longer than desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A chunk of that blame falls squarely on action sequences, such as a fight between King Kong and a pair of tyrannosauruses that lasted a full 3 minutes by itself. This wasn’t the last time that Peter Jackson sullied an otherwise good movie with overlong scenes that halt all story progression for little more than a CG animated aside, but it’s probably the time the movie was the least damaged by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/directors-who-made-action-films-boring/Watchmen_wide.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-watchmen-2009&quot;&gt;4. &lt;em&gt;Watchmen (2009)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widely considered to be a near impossible accomplishment, Zack Snyder managed to bring a smoldering, nuanced, and mature graphic novel to the big screen. However, Watchmen only sits at a mediocre 65%, even the more forgiving general audiences have only rated it at 71%. Critics frequently list the superhuman fight scenes as one of the biggest flaws with Watchmen, a movie that is already a little long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening with a punching match between The Comedian and his unknown assailant, the tone of the movie is set right from the beginning with two super humans punching each other endlessly for over 3 minutes. It’s impossible to even be invested in it as neither character appears to suffer pain, shaking off every single punch like it’s nothing. It’s hard to argue that Watchmen wouldn’t have benefited for a more subdued tone, and a shorter run time, and scenes like this are just begging to be cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watcmen only ranks number four on our list because these flaws didn’t diminish the incredible accomplishment of converting a story once considered impossible to film, and to do so with exceptional flare. However, it is hard to say that we couldn’t have gotten something better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/directors-who-made-action-films-boring/man-of-boredom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-man-of-steel-2013&quot;&gt;3. &lt;em&gt;Man of Steel (2013)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zack Snyder strikes again with this 2013 snore fest. Even fans of the Man of Steel find it hard to defend invincible aliens slugging it out with no consequences for anyone except the poor people unfortunate enough to build homes and businesses near their battlegrounds. Snyder is an otherwise competent director, so his insistence on scenes that halt the movie and for which we are never afraid for the well being of any of the combatants is a bit mind boggling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weighing in at &lt;em&gt;over four and a half minutes&lt;/em&gt;, the Smallville fight scene pauses the progression of the story for a punching match between two characters who we know are invincible. Tiresome and repetitive, it’s a slog of a scene, and not the only one in the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe it’s a strong contributing factor to the 55% percent that Man of Steel currently enjoys from Rotten Tomatoes. Man of Steel only ranks at number three on this list because Superman hadn’t really been hot in film leading up to this, and the movie around it was filled with a plethora of other problems, so there wasn’t much damage to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/directors-who-made-action-films-boring/matrix-crimes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-the-matrix-reloaded-2003&quot;&gt;2. &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Reloaded (2003)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the critical and financial success of the first Matrix movie, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Reloaded&lt;/em&gt; was poised to take the world by storm. With 1999’s &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, the Wachowskis created an intense roller coaster ride where every single fight and action scene was an integral part of the story where the status quo changed and characters evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike its predecessor, however, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Reloaded&lt;/em&gt; used fight scenes for filler. Memorable for watching Neo be swamped by fake looking rag doll versions of Mr. Smith, or endlessly hopping across car tops, it’s hard to be invested in a film that follows up such a lasting masterpiece with so little plot across its run time. Given the side by side comparison to the original, this is a perfect example of how more is not the same as better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to throwing away so much audience good will, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Reloaded&lt;/em&gt; was more than up to the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/directors-who-made-action-films-boring/hobbit-desolation-of-tolkien.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-the-hobbit-the-desolation-of-smaug-2013&quot;&gt;1. &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dubious honor of the movie worst afflicted by boring and lifeless fight scenes that extend well past their welcome is Peter Jackson’s &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug&lt;/em&gt;. It’s hard to pick just one sequence from this film to warrant propelling this entry to the top of the list. Audiences must trudge through never ending barrel rides down a river or downright Loony Toons chases through the inside of a mountain, both of which detract from the narrative and contribute nothing for the time they consume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ridiculous and over the top nature of every action sequence in this movie solidifies it in the number one spot for this list. Between the stifflingly dull film making and how Jackson underwhelmingly conveyed this beloved action adventure novel, you’ll find yourself falling to sleep while trying to endure the 3 hour and 7 minute runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Jackson was hot off of the landmark achievement of transforming &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; to one of the all time great motion pictures, in part by making it more like it’s more action oriented prequel. It’s easy to see how he was tempted to draw &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; out to be more like it’s longer more epic follow up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Jackson had been more reserved and used a more level sense of pacing and less overtly cartoonish action sequences, we might have gotten the follow up we deserved.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/10/2016-10-27-review-american-pastoral.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Pastoral&lt;/em&gt; is like an unraveling sweater, it’s got some really big problems that all start with just a few threads coming undone. Stilted acting, wooden dialog, and an unoriginal soundtrack all build to highlight an unfortunate and depressing slog of a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story opens with some awkward exposition delivered with cardboard grade passion. A passionless and bland introduction that fails to even work as retrospective reverence of an era gone by. You’d almost think that the 60s and 70s were so far back that it’s not possible to engagingly communicate the context required to hold up a movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s surprising is that &lt;em&gt;American Pastoral&lt;/em&gt; is filled with talented and capable actors who all feel like they are better than this, and you can even tell that they’re trying to do something with their delivery. It just doesn’t work though. To be fair, though you can largely rule out the quality of the acting given the large amount of affected talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/american-pastoral/american-pastoral-ewan-looking-martyrly.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that the directing is otherwise competent, it must be assumed that the writing is the source of the stiffness here. However, capable directing is not always a good thing. By merely effectively capturing the story, and failing to impart anything remarkably good or bad, a sort of blandness results, preventing this from being a credit to the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sins are subjective, and a lot of viewers may not be bothered by them, and it will certainly be fair for others to argue that overall the execution is comparatively pretty average. There has certainly been worse writing, worse delivery, and it’s hardly damning to call a film mediocre, but &lt;em&gt;American Pastoral&lt;/em&gt; not mediocre. These smaller, and sometimes less noticeable issues, all act as highlights for the real problem here, the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise: The Swede is a near flawless example of human perfection. Exemplary at all sports, volunteered for World War II, beauty queen wife, and owner of a small business that hires a multi-cultural staff even in the 50s onward. He is kind, attentive, caring, sensitive, and when the time comes, he’s even opposed to the Vietnam war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/american-pastoral/money-shot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the turbulence of the sixties and seventies, The Swede’s daughter falls in with anti war revolutionaries and disappears, resulting in the slow dissolution of his life as he perpetually seeks to find and redeem her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overtones at best over glorify and idolize the gilded edges of a point in American history that marginalized and disenfranchised anyone outside of the the white male head of a household and business owner. A better conclusion is that the ideal core nuclear family with a strong moral core was sacrificed by social progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d argue that even audiences who are able to forgive flawed writing and underwhelming acting and directing would find it hard to slog through life just beating the crap out of a guy whose core flaw is being too perfect. As a counter point, I think &lt;em&gt;The Passion of the Christ&lt;/em&gt; actually did pretty well, so who knows how well &lt;em&gt;American Pastoral&lt;/em&gt; will do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/american-pastoral/physical-distance-between-characters-as-metaphor-for-emotional-rift.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t even say that the music is a saving grace, despite being filled with powerful and emotional songs. Every movie about the 60s, 70s, and cultural revolution uses a similar soundtrack, it’s like a checklist almost. You’d be better off watching Forest Gump for the millionth time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the irritation of the dialog and writing started under my skin, the unpleasantness of the content dug at me, and I couldn’t stop thinking about the overall implications of the story. It all left me with an extremely bitter and terrible taste in my mouth after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real die hard drama fans may enjoy &lt;em&gt;American Pastoral&lt;/em&gt; despite it being a middling film. Most should avoid this trudge through flawed mediocrity and watch something better instead.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/10/2016-10-25-horror-classics-night-of-the-living-dead-1968.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Though subdued when compared to later works of grotesque indulgence, the original Night of the Living Dead is tense and unrelenting. The key to savoring it is in buying into a rural mindset and suspending your disbelief in the situation. By limiting its scope and location, director George Romero manages to pull this off and create a lasting work that may still haunt viewers today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I found incredibly surprising about Night of the Living Dead, is that it almost felt like a parody of itself. Where many later works criticized the original zombies for being slow and ineffective, I expected this to be a logical flaw in film’s narrative that I would have to overlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/night-of-the-living-dead-1968/night-of-the-living-dead-cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the contrary, George Romero deliberately made his zombies fatal only to the most inattentive and self destructive of people. This is underscored and outright stated in news broadcasts visible to the audience throughout the story. In the midst of the chaos experienced by the protagonists the audience is given television close-ups of militia groups wiping out entire masses of zombies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During one news broadcast interview, there is the following incredible exchange:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Field Reporter&lt;/strong&gt;: Are they slow-moving, chief?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sheriff McClelland&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, they’re dead. They’re all messed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The narrative issue I was most concerned about was directly addressed in an aside that is directly targeted at the audience, in the very first movie to define zombies as cannibalistic undead. The brilliance here is that it means that their ineffectiveness is deliberate and purposeful. So the question becomes, why are they ineffective, and what does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only possible conclusion and purpose for this is damningly clear: that the fate of the protagonists rests entirely within the realm of their own internal conflict. When they die, they only truly die because they have killed themselves. This includes when the zombies act as agents of their death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/night-of-the-living-dead-1968/barbara-confused-scared.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is reinforced in smaller ways throughout the movie. For one, with the exception of the very first death in the film, every single death is the direct result of a failure of character, carelessness, or outright murder. This is an extreme movie that makes a mundane statement about how we treat each other, about how our cowardice, our frailty of will, and our inability to support each other is definitively destructive on a mortal level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are told directly as an audience that what is happening outside is just a distraction and is inconsequential when addressed rationally and cooperatively, and then we are shown a diverse group of people overwhelmed by this empty threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internal disorientation and stress the characters undergo is reinforced by the gore, and by the sharp and aggressive cinematography. As a director, Romero chooses intense and uncomfortable angles for his lens into this world. Viewers feel it, even as they feel the tension through the dialog, and the acting of the characters: fear, frustration, and despair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/night-of-the-living-dead-1968/cleaning-up-the-zombies.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a single jump scare, Romero creates a feeling of uncomfortable distress that lasts even after the end credits roll, and has produced a work with a narrative that is timeless and can entertain and upset thoughtful viewers even today. Romero went on to reinforce these themes in all of his films, from &lt;em&gt;Dawn of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; all the way through his more recent works, such as &lt;em&gt;Survival of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there may be debate over which Romero film is executed with more technical skill, if you haven’t seen &lt;em&gt;Night of the Living Dead&lt;/em&gt;, you owe it to yourself to experience this masterwork.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/10/2016-10-25-review-jack-reacher-never-go-back.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is the second entry in the Jack Reacher franchise. It is a utilitarian action adventure that doesn’t have a lot to say. It’s strongest when it focuses on the interpersonal conflicts of the protagonists and it has plenty of action, despite overall having a forgettable story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequently movies may be criticized for following predictable patterns and well established templates for their genre. Arguably, however, this same adherence to a well tested recipe can allow a filmmaker to refine the overall quality of film making and display particular accomplishment in cinematography, choreography, pacing, writing, or even acting. Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is an excellent example of quality execution elevating an otherwise generic work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/jack-reacher-never-go-back/jack-reacher-kitchen.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the areas that particularly stands out is a muted performance from Tom Cruise. There is no surprise in the talent and ability of Tom Cruise being able to highlight the aspects of Jack Reacher that make him unique as a character: thoughtful and direct. Little to no time is lost on moments of indecision or superfluous conversation. This doubly works toward the strength of the film as a whole, as it wastes almost no time at all, using all of its scenes and dialog purposefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cobie Smulders is equally well used as she acts opposite Cruise in her portrayal of Major Turner. The well rounded development of Turner is one of the more endearing aspects of the casting and writing. Major Turner adds a nuance to the internal conflict of the protagonists, capturing an counterpoint to Reacher that elevates the interactions between the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action of Jack Reacher is effectively choreographed. Not as sparse or brutally simplified as John Wick, Never Go Back still has a trim style. Most of the fights, chases, and short and sweet. This sort of restraint is, frankly, still refreshing in an overall environment of excessive overlong action sequences that functionally halt the story telling. We are definitely treated to a sweet spot here, where we’re given enough to savor and enjoy, but not enough to bore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its narrative is where Never Go Back is weakest. The finer details of the story were already evaporating from my mind even as I left the theater. I still remember the broader strokes, but what I’m left with is more like an impressionists version of a story. All the major events are flat and the finer details just didn’t feel important enough to stick out, especially not against the well developed character interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/jack-reacher-never-go-back/a-reacher-parade.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably because the antagonists are so thinly defined. We never get more than a few minutes with them as a whole. Never Go Back is so primarily focused with the relationships conflicts of reacher himself, that the actual villains of the story are little more than the background noise to highlight them. You’ll be hard pressed to remember anything particularly interesting about any of the figures that Reacher struggles against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At worst, though, these are primarily sins of omission. You only miss them when you’re looking for them. There’s enough memorable conflict in the development of the protagonists that these deficiencies will not be much missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never Go Back succeeds by being aggressively direct and to the point. It moves effortlessly from moment to moment, and is downright utilitarian in its use of action sequences. Ultimately, this is a well acted, effectively directed, and at times even cleverly written summer blockbuster that may not be special enough for audiences who are exhausted of empty action flicks. However, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back will be fondly remembered by those who are in the mood for a light, but satisfying, action adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/10/2016-10-20-review-keeping-up-with-the-joneses.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/keeping-up-with-the-joneses-2016/joneses-banner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real brilliance of Keeping Up with the Joneses (2016) is the chemistry of the cast and how they respond to each other and play off each others foils. What keeps it from greatness is a largely forgettable and and throwaway story. While the movie is technically well executed, outside of some fun chase scenes, no aspect outside of the acting and dialog writing really adds anything extra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the real highlights of the cast is Zach Galifianakis, who shines outstandingly as Jeff Gafney. A diverse character actor, Zach performs at his very best when he captures the warmth of character. In a way that few other comedians are able to do, he manages to make you feel like he really understands the awkwardness of being fairly normal. This really makes you feel like he’s laughing with you, at the pain of being stuck somewhere without writers giving you the exact perfect thing to say in every situation. He feels human, and vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isla Fisher, always on point, brings her own type of special to that dynamic, working with Zach’s talent for embodying these awkward and vulnerable characters and adding to it by imbuing her role as Karen Gaffney with a clever playfulness. She balances out the core relationship of the film with a sense of fun that actually allows Zach to tone down some of his rougher edges that detract from his performances in other films. She even gets more than enough time to stand completely on her own as the fantastic comedian and character actor that she has time and again brought to each of her previous endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/keeping-up-with-the-joneses-2016/keeping-up-with-the-joneses-zach-galifianakis-jon-hamm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Hamm and Gal Gadot work as an awesome power couple. Functionally falling into supporting roles, they act as perfect foils in their embodiment of human perfection that highlights the fun of the normality of Galifianakis and Fisher. The relationship that develops between the characters of Hamm and Galifianakis has a really charming affect. Possibly the weakest link here is Gal Gadot, with a few of her deliveries feeling a bit thin, but with the rest of the cast, including roles played by Matt Walsh and Patton Oswalt, most viewers wont even notice when her dialog delivery is a little flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, with all of this chemistry, the plot itself is fairly dull. It feels rehashed. Whether this is the best version of a normal couple entangled with super spies or not, it just is not that engaging of a use of such wonderful chemistry and this is absolutely palpable. Most viewers will likely begin forgetting the major plot points even before the movie is over despite having been given plenty of good laughs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/keeping-up-with-the-joneses-2016/hamm-gadot-joneses.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some passable action scenes, the pacing is clean, and the cinematography is competent. Is competency enough? If this movie hits a special place for you, it definitely is. However, most viewers likely wont remember this movie as much more than an amusing adventure. Maybe there’s a lack of depth, maybe it’s because it lacks teeth. We never hurt for any of these characters, and so we don’t have any pain to latch onto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These weaknesses are small, though. The worst thing you could possibly say about it is that it doesn’t try to do anything really special. By playing it safe, the film has failed to produce something more lasting. If you are looking for a fun and engaging way to spend a few hours, Keeping Up with the Joneses is a great way to get that. It delivers some great laughs and some fun action along the way, and is definitely a worthwhile watch.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/10/2016-10-18-horror-classics-the-thing-1982.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Few filmmakers have a legacy that will compare favorably to that of John Carpenter. Carpenter has created some of the most memorable franchises and cult classic films of all time: Escape from L.A., Halloween, They Live, The Fog, Assault on Precinct 13, Dark Star, and Big Trouble in Little China, just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is arguable, however, that The Thing (1982) may be the gem of his career and the movie that finds the perfect balance in cinematography, writing, acting, and music almost in the same way that it finds the balance between science fiction, horror, suspense, and drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film is based on the novella “Who Goes There?” by John W. Campbell Jr, which was more loosely adapted by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby as the 1951 film The Thing from Another World. What makes it such an outstanding horror film (outside of being so well made that it still feels contemporary by modern standards) is how it intertwines 3 major elements of discomfort: isolation, paranoia, and the apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/the-thing-1982/macready-thing-kurt-russel.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Layering these elements together narratively as well as metaphorically through the environment and the cinematography is an impressive accomplishment that is rarely seen in any genre, and is particularly impressive in horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thing shares common properties with other monsters that convert their prey, bolstering their number by consumption, such as vampires, pod people, and the like. However, the body horror induced by the violent conversion of the consumed as the infestation spreads from host to host is so extreme, and the totally converted hosts are so completely normal and unchanged, that the dread more successfully explores the feeling of being alone and in constant danger rather than deeper metaphors about the monster itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other movies about the consumption of the host, there’s even a question of whether or not someone who is infected might even know that they had been changed. How can you trust yourself? At what moment would you stop being you? Even as we follow Kurt Russell as the protagonist MacReady, we doubt his humanity. We see him even test himself. The paranoia festers with the doubt and the isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/the-thing-1982/the-thing-1982-landscape.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a compounding element to this, the subtle fear that not only might the protagonists have lost themselves, but that in doing so they may have made it possible for a thing so virulent that it will destroy the world to escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the subtle tools that The Thing uses to capitalize on all of these themes is the scope of the environment. Opening with the beautiful landscapes surrounding the Antarctic research facility that is the focal point of the events to unfold, the audience is given a sense of vast scale and endless beauty. As the nightmare unfolds, night falls, tightening our awareness to the facility itself. Next, the storm comes, enclosing us within the ever more confining walls. Room upon room is destroyed by the conflict, reducing our freedom to ever tighter spaces even as we trust those around us less and less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/the-thing-1982/thing-macready-claustrophobic.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a profound beauty in how the shift in scale contracts. Where other apocalyptic films try to pull back for a wider view, The Thing pushes inward, squeezing the viewers into an increasingly uncomfortable space. The threat grows even as the protagonists chip away at it. This mirroring of narrative with the direction is profound and exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rarely do we get to see so much layering from the ground up in a film, and when we do it’s truly breathtaking to behold. The Thing is still one of my all time favorite horror movies, and continues to be a must watch for horror fans today.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/10/2016-10-13-review-denial.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Denial is a surprising film in that it uses the material as a vehicle to say something completely different from what you might imagine. The premise is fairly straightforward, Denial tells the story of David Irving vs Penguin Books, in which a Holocaust denier presses charges against Deborah Lipstadt for defamation of his character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setup is so cleanly cut and overt that it is easy to miss what the story is really about, even though the audience is told what questions they should be asking in the very first scene. We’re told to think constantly about how much proof we have about what happened in the past and how concrete that proof is. Right away this is an intriguing premise, to consider how something so monumental in world history could have so little definitive proof of its existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all we have is the unreliable testimony of eye-witnesses and survivors, then it all fades away as soon as they’ve faded away. The evidence of what happened could literally die off. Given this, the movie takes on the heavy burden of exploring the topic of the Holocaust without the easy fallback of survivor testimony. We’ve seen that before, and it’s easy, it’s easy because it’s emotional. It’s easy because when you have a face to look into, it disarms you, and you connect with them, especially when they have so much pain that it’s transparent in everything they say and do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/denial-2016/denial-timothy-spall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be weird to think of the Holocaust as a subject that is rarely approached from a mature angle, but when you stop and think about it, it almost never is. This is &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the evidence is so lacking, and why a trial like this ever happened. Denial is subtle in how it approaches these questions, and then further prods us to constantly think about making hard choices: sitting still in the face of those who offend us, avoiding the easy answers to hard questions, and working diligently to be prepared to answer hard questions in a way that will last forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Director Mike Jackson really shines when it comes to placing these questions and answers down almost casually, but close enough to have the audience connect the dots. Narrative construction is where Denial shines the most, conveying what we need to think about and what we need to ask with a grace that appears effortless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/denial-2016/denial_tom_wilkinson.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of dialog here that is meticulously written and a lot can be unpacked from just a little bit. What’s more, is it’s delivered with nuance by a cast of actors with outstanding careers and talent. Rachel Weisz’ portrayal of Deborah is solid, and manages to successfully hit the most important notes of her character arc, and is strongest in the places where it needs to be when she is most challenged by her inner conflict. Her performance falls apart in one or two scenes which are forgivable in the larger context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom Wilkinson knocks it out of the park with his portrayal of Richard Rampton. His level disposition feel as though they carry the film, and you can feel the difference when he’s not present on screen. Timothy Spall lands a convincing portrayal of David Irving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A movie with so much legal nuance requires a large amount of exposition to prepare the audience to understand the actions in the courtroom. It can be challenging to outright instruct the audience on what is happening without having them feel alienated, but Andrew Scott’s portrayal of Anthony Julius successfully entertains while giving us a tour of the ins and outs of a libel case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/denial-2016/denial_deborah_lipstadt_rachel_wiesz.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rarely does a movie enthrallingly tell the story of good decision making, as drama is rarely the product of mature behavior. Denial’s goal of asking us to be more mindful of how we document history, having us take a second look to think about when and how we get evidence of what we believe, and following this up with messages about restraining our emotions when taking an argument to a place that is more humanly satisfying is refreshing and enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the weighty topics that Denial uses as its groundwork, it lives and breathes in easier space. Every bit as entertaining as it is thoughtful, Denial is a must watch for 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/10/2016-10-11-horror-classics-the-alien-franchise.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;The Alien franchise is one of the longest running franchises in movie history. Not counting crossover movies with the Predator franchise, the Alien universe spans 5 films (with an 6th slated for 2017) and 38 years since Ridley Scott first made the original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I want to speak about many of these films in great depth in future retrospectives, here I want to take a broader look at the franchise as a whole. With so many talented artists, writers, directors, and composers working independently across so many eras of cinema, few continuous franchises can give us as profound a look into changing tastes and styles. Where we started with Alien and where we are now after Prometheus are two very different places and I want to explore that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few franchises have such a strong start. Alien (1979) is one of the most lasting sci-fi horror films in cinematic history, with some of the most deliberate pacing, progressive character development, thoughtful suspense, and terrifying monsters of all time. Xenomorphs, the primary extraterrestrial antagonist in the Alien franchise, is the manifestation of an apex predator that survives through sexual predation that births itself by eating its victims from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evocative style of the xenomorphs, based on the work of H.R. Giger, haunt you on a subconscious level. They are organized in their chaos, and grotesque in their macabre physique. Simultaneously monstrous and admirable, grotesque and aesthetically engrossing, a series of paradoxical elements all come to life at once and working harmoniously with the narrative terrors they were meant to embody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/alien-franchise/the-xenomorph.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opposing the xenomorphs is the Weyland-Yutani corporation. While we sometimes get a brief glimpse into them as a mega corporation creating everything from toys and clothes to moving vast intergalactic mining operations, they primarily serve as an invisible foil. A wall against which the aliens push the protagonists, undermining their survival from beyond reach in ways that can be subtle and sometimes aggressively overt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each new director to create a film in the franchise has managed to take this creature in fundamentally new directions and sculpt unique interpretations. All of these entries have preserved the sense of claustrophobia caused by the being caught between extraterrestrial predators and the amorphous touch of corporate greed from afar. Even the debatably poor films in the franchise find new spaces to explore and viewed these core elements of the fear of the unknown vs. the terrors from within through the lenses of different genres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/alien-franchise/weyland-makes-toys.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alien-1979&quot;&gt;Alien (1979)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ridley Scott’s Alien is a slow burning thriller that uses all of its worldbuilding to make the fantastical (space travel, alien creatures, suspended animation) feel mundane. By having dark and dank areas of the ship where the plumbing is done and crew members bantering about pay and contractual responsibilities, we get the sense here more than almost any other sci-fi movie of a future we can almost believe before Scott begins grinding the protagonists down between the xenomorph and the very ship keeping the crew alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constantly reminded that so very little stands between the crew and empty space, we feel starkly isolated. Ridley puts the characters in a place of extreme vulnerability. They are starving for resources, and have no weapons with which to protect themselves. No one ever feels truly safe or comfortable in this film, and what little that they do have to grab onto is systematically taken away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lead of Alien, Ellen Ripley, was portrayed by Sigourney Weaver. Her performance stands, even today, as one of the most strong and nuanced female protagonists. Sigourney would continue to return as Ripley through the next 3 sequels, though it is easy to argue that the original Alien is the strongest writing that her character has received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aliens-1986&quot;&gt;Aliens (1986)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the original Alien, John Cameron’s Aliens redefined the franchise and is remembered by many as the height of the Alien films. Moving away from the slow thriller formula, Cameron set his focus on undermining humanity when we are in a place of confidence, as opposed to Ridley’s narrative of constant human frailty. The core premise of Aliens starts with an elite group of soldiers with combat gear that embodies the peak of human achievement actively seeking out conflict with a xenomorph infestation. They are clad in armor, carrying high caliber weapons, and equipped with vehicles and numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film is about upsetting the feeling of invulnerability presented by such a strong setup, and eating away at the feeling of confidence the audience is supposed to have. As with the original, though, we’re served with a combination of punches in succession to knock us down. The xenomorphs first, as they overwhelm with numbers and with no regard for their own individual needs. Then, after the soldiers are weakened, we again experience the sabotage of the machinations of the Weyland-Yutani corporation prompting Ripley to verbalize the question: Which is the worst monster? Them or us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/alien-franchise/alien-egg-chamber.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aliens breaches the action adventure genre more than casually, arguably transitioning fully from its thriller origins by ending with a large set piece action sequence that gave audiences more of a bang to remember as they leave the theater than the whimper of the original. It’s fair to say that in their own ways, Alien and Aliens are each the very best of the genre they represent to this very day: sci-fi horror, and action adventure horror respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alien-3-1992&quot;&gt;Alien 3 (1992)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here we reach an interesting point in the franchise history, as both Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection have strong parallels with the original films. Alien 3 was directed by David Fincher. At this point, you should start to notice a trend emerging of some of the best writers and directors of our time having hands in this franchise. David Fincher’s Alien 3 attempts to move back to the roots of the franchise, creating a space where humanity feels trapped, and then grinding the protagonists up between the environment and extraterrestrial menace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There really isn’t a lot more to say than that about Alien 3. A lot of Alien lore began with this movie’s portrayal of the xenomorph, which in both versions of the film is a hybrid of a xenomorph and an animal other than human. It’s a weaker film in the franchise. David Fincher tells a story of the members of a prison colony, all shaved bald to defend against a lice infestation, trying to survive against a xenomorph escaped within the facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Striping down all of the characters of hair and placing them all in disheveled unisex clothes removes humanity from the protagonists as Fincher explores our own hive like behaviors to attempt to survive. The theatrical cut missed a lot of the heart and insight of the film and audiences largely rejected it as it veered away from the action formula of Aliens, but failed to quite live up to the standard of the original Alien. You’ll probably find that how much a person likes it depends so much on whether they liked Alien or Aliens more. Fans who feel that the atmosphere and horror of the original were more satisfying than the action adventure transition often very much enjoy Alien 3, while fans of the later get neither the action of Aliens, nor the unparalleled excellence of the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, though, the director’s cut of Alien 3 is an excellent film, and contains a lot of the fingerprints of Fincher’s later work. His exploration of individuality ultimately does help this movie stand on its own as a unique vision. His interpretation of Ripley is arguably the second best in the series as her emotional range expands, giving her more agency and freedom to make meaningful decisions than in Aliens, if lacking the more distinct female perspective that she was able to express in Alien. There is a lot more to explore here as Alien 3 relates to the work of Fincher, more so than any other director on this list, and it is worth doing in a future analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alien-resurrection-1997&quot;&gt;Alien: Resurrection (1997)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to Alien 3, Alien: Resurrection was deeply undermined by not feeling different enough different enough. It was Aliens without the horror or polish, and it gave nothing to fans of the tense atmospheric horror roots of Alien. It’s easy to see why audiences largely felt like they were watching Aliens all over again, but not quite as good. This isn’t really fair, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failing to satisfy fans of either Alien or Aliens, Resurrection is all the same a very interesting film. Written by Joss Whedon and directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Alien 4 is a uniquely weird movie. The work here is so playful with the subject matter and different that it isn’t fair to simply label it as bad. The pacing is strong, and the cast includes entertaining performances from Ron Perlman, Dominique Pinon, Winona Ryder, Dan Hedaya, and others, including the return of Sigourney Weaver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whedon’s more action centric narrative and less heady sense for science fiction is more interested in creating a space for character evolution, looking at the relationship between humans and our own creations that places characters in a vicegrip of multi faceted predators. Similarly, characteristic of his other works, Jeunet focuses on finding a sense of style in the universe that is wholly unique. Engaging both the characters and environments in an almost cartoonish use of the camera, Jeunet’s work is gleeful in watching humanity destroy itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a pair, Jean-Pierre Jeunet created a space that’s so playful with angles and unusual environments as to be fun, and Whedon wrote a film that puts the corporate interests and extraterrestrial menace in the forefront of the film. Watched in series, though, viewers may find it too hard to separate Resurrection from the action roots that the franchise evoked in Aliens. Jeunet’s focus on emotion through charicature could only draw negative comparisons against the genius of Cameron’s technical mastery of the craft and focus on cohesive writing, as these are Jeunet’s weaknesses. Viewers who can let go of that baggage frequently do find a film that has its own voice and is a fun ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/alien-franchise/prometheus-meeting-god.png&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prometheus-2012&quot;&gt;Prometheus (2012)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ridley Scott bookends the series as it currently stands. Prometheus doubles as a chance to look at his growth as a film maker over the course of 30 years. Alien and Blade Runner stand as some of the greatest works of science fiction of all time largely because of his willingness to forgo action for intimate story telling and a pacing that furthers the suspension of disbelief which is fostered by his dedication to building unforgettable worlds that hold their own weight. Whether fortunately or unfortunately, Ridley appears completely disinterested in making an Alien film, resulting in an ambitious but flawed film almost completely divorced from the tone and themes of the franchise as a whole, which is a remarkable task given the wide range of unique interpretations created by the talented filmmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ironic hubris of Prometheus is that it is too ambitious, as Scott uses it to attempt to reframe the very nature of the xenomorphs. Many felt it was too subtle in its points, aggressive editing left genuine plot holes that were all too easy to confuse with the holes that were deliberately left to encourage us to make our own conclusions. To discuss the relationship of Prometheus to the Alien franchise would require a larger look that I want to do in this piece far richer in spoilers than are appropriate for this retrospective and is too loosely related to the themes of the work as a whole to be worth the tangent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prometheus uses all of the elements of human curiosity by using the perspective of scientists for the first time in the series, and it asks the question, “What if God exists, is tangible, and can be found, and what if that God doesn’t want us?” The movie is filled with these questions. Originally intended as a more direct prequel to the series, Scott became enamored with these questions and changed the entire direction of the film. The overt shift in themes, tone, and even the entire purpose of the film likely are what led to the issues of overall narrative construction that prevented those who could have seen what Ridley was doing from appreciating the film, while simultaneously completely failing to deliver anything of substance to fans looking for an Alien film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too different and too broken, few appreciated Scott’s beautiful use of color and cinematography to draw us into a terrifying place and the intimidating question of what it would mean to be able to meet our maker and how hollow it would make us feel to be unsatisfied with what we found and terrified by that maker immediately seeking to destroy us for having found it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/alien-franchise/Neill-Blomkamps-Alien.png&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future&quot;&gt;The Future&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no wonder that this franchise keeps coming back, or that some of our most interesting writers and directors have used it to explore new and pioneering spaces. The Alien franchise has produced such a broad range of work. The very diverse audiences that each vision appeals to are likely the reason why the entries are so well separated by time. With every new film, audiences need that time to be able to digest it and learn to love the films in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neill Blomkamp is working on a sixth entry into the series of films that is considered canon. Given his work with Chappie, District 9, and Elysium I feel it is safe to say that we will continue to see Alien films that manage to carve their own niche and still say something new and unique with every visit, and I am &lt;em&gt;excited&lt;/em&gt; to see what we get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only have one requirement: Sharlto Copley had better be in it.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/10/2016-10-06-review-birth-of-a-nation.markdown":"&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The Birth of a Nation&lt;/em&gt; contains depictions of graphic violence, brutality, and casual torture that are deeply affecting and profoundly upsetting. Sensitive viewers should use caution when viewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the movies that are the hardest to watch are the ones that are most important. &lt;em&gt;The Birth of a Nation&lt;/em&gt; takes a hard look at one of the great shames of humanity as a whole during a time when it was an American institution, and uses it as a lens to show how the systematic oppression of a people destroys the souls of both the oppressed and the oppressors. The uncomfortable impact of the character arcs and the emotional toll taken by violence and the environment are so overt that most viewers will overlook the few flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Written, produced, and directed by Nate Parker, &lt;em&gt;The Birth of a Nation&lt;/em&gt; is a dramatized biography of Nat Turner and Nat Turner’s Rebellion (also known as the Southampton Insurrection). Nate Parker further stretches himself by taking the lead role, Nat Turner. Nate manages to deliver an inspired performance despite the challenges of so much responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/birth-of-a-nation-2016/birth-nation-dreams.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opposite Nate Parker, Armie Hammer as Samuel Turner successfully captures the slow erosion of the human soul as we are given a long view of his life from childhood to maturity and the damage of slave ownership and slave culture on his disposition and temperament. Even as the audience is taken on a guided tour of grotesque abuse, we are shown Samuel Turner slowly become all of the things that initially tear him apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the top violence and gore are not uncommon in modern cinema, though it would be fair to say that only a small few films really use it appropriately. When well executed, the horror of the real and the embrace of the degradation of humanity in conjunction with the destruction of the body leave the viewer vulnerable. &lt;em&gt;The Birth of a Nation&lt;/em&gt; uses that vulnerability to prepare us to accept the destruction of every character touched by it as inevitable. Unlike its contemporaries, here this uncompromising insight into the worst isn’t the point, but rather to prepare the audience for the emotional pain that surrounds it and to heighten our awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/birth-of-a-nation-2016/birth-of-a-nation-wedding.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the environment drives all of the themes of the movie home. The religious fervor, the woods, the fields, and the barns all paired with the music and the people to capture a place in time. Tinged with the mingling of Christianity with the ceremonies and mysticism of the African culture. Nate Parker uses color sparsely, mingling the real world and dreams by muting their tones, except for when he uses red. It’s visually striking and it stands out and grabs your attention and heightens your awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these aspects, the characters, the pain, and the world building, come together to put the audience through a grueling experience that will leave most drained and spent by the climax. It’s such an intense ride that few will notice the flaws that mar the overall work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/birth-of-a-nation-2016/pain-and-tragedy-birth-of-a-nation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the issues here are systemic, most of them a failing of a single moment here or a moment there. A character having an unexplained shift in behavior to propel the plot one way, then another when it is convenient. A few lines of dialog are heavy handed observations on the parallels with current events. Well delivered, but still clumsily written, they land with stilted weight and are felt but don’t entirely take hold like they should given the severity of their subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These can’t be blamed on laziness or a lack of unity of vision. At worst it feels like they’re used to say something that needed to be said, but couldn’t be don’t quite well enough with the material, or as little escapes from places where the story moves into a corner where the characters are unable to move forward with the existing setup. They’re small, and ultimately forgettable in the face of what is otherwise a masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Birth of a Nation&lt;/em&gt; is a modern classic that will be remembered for generations to come as an uncompromising exploration of the failure of violent rebellion to oppose systemic cultural oppression and abuse. If you are able to withstand the painful nature of such a violent rebellion and the culture that created an environment that made it all but unavoidable, and graphic depictions of soul crushing violence, then this is an important film to watch. These are feelings that should be experienced and remembered. It hurts, but it’s a healing hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoiler Warning&lt;/strong&gt;: This is an in depth exploration of the themes and ideas of the 1985 classic “The Return of the Living Dead.” Specific events and their significance will be discussed in detail. It is recommended that you watch it before reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most over used monsters in horror today is the zombie. In the past decade or more there is unlikely to be a single year where zombies have failed to loom tall on the silver screen, though rarely are we served a thoughtful work that uses them as a tool to explore our fears and anxieties. Ironically, though, zombies are likely only as popular as they are &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of how well they have been used in the past to better understand and reflect on so many different ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of what they are, ourselves, contorted and without reason, zombies are an effective tool for looking deeper into the ways in which we fail each other and the bonds of trust that hold our societies together. Zombies have been used metaphorically to embody consumers and communists, act as a catalyst to highlight the worst of humanity in crisis situations, and embody a literally contagion. Thematically, the zombie may be the most versatile and flexible of all movie monsters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/return-of-the-living-dead/the-victims-of-folley.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Return of the Living Dead uses an entire array of the most prevalent terrors of living in 1985 America, such as nuclear proliferation, unrestrained and misunderstood science, and a rampant and unchecked military all to serve as an underline for the ultimate terror of the film: incompetence on every level of society to a degree that must ultimately collapse. It is the common theme in each and every failing as the film escalates from a single contained zombie to catastrophic uncontainable catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost clinical in its methodology, the introduction sets the tone by opening with a new employee getting a tour of a medical warehouse briefly interrupted with establishing shots for the characters whose stories will be told in parallel. Slightly goofy, but tinged in darkness as the warehouse workers joke about the cadavers they work with. During this tour the origin of the zombie is explained in clear detail, and the audience is shown their first horror locked away in a barrel, the remnant of a long ago contained nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is so brilliant about this opening is that it ensures that the zombies themselves are the least horrifying part of the movie. They are clearly explained immediately as a product of science and subsequently placed on display for us. Even as the chemical menace escapes into the air, one of the first real horrors of the film is released through the mishandling of the barrel in which the creature resides, the credits begin to roll and the audience is given a clear extended shot of the face of what is contained within. This is because this isn’t the horror of this movie, it’s already explained, and it’s placed on display here as misdirection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/return-of-the-living-dead/Return_Of_The_Living_Dead_French_sex_and_death.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a subversion of our expectations this works perfectly, fans of Night of the Living Dead are here for more zombies, they expect them to be the core of the film, and The Return of the Living Dead doesn’t disappoint, even while it builds all of its horror in the negative space surrounding them. The gas is terrifying because we can’t understand it or see it, and we don’t know what it’s doing to the people it’s touched. The society is a nightmare, as everyone with any responsibility for containing this hazard, a danger that was well contained and should never have been more than ghastly display, fails completely in their responsibility. In these successive failings we see the real killer of the film: institutional incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theme is easy to miss, given how well and how sincerely the movie proceeds to hit on its sub themes: having this lab created chemical spread. Culminating in the military decision to use atomic weapons to stop it, and ultimately resulting in the indestructible gas merely being evaporated and spread even further via the rain because of their use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/return-of-the-living-dead/The-Return-Of-The-Living-Dead_nuclear_bomb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The zombie, though? It is inert in the first moment we see it,  and it is frail. Slow, and filled with constant pain from its unnatural existence, these abominations are more to be pitied than feared. They’re the core of the film, and even as the audience is revolted by them, there is a frailty that cuts deep. Time and again, what makes the horde is not the individual corruption of mortality, but the failure on every level to contain something so sickly and decayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps no other zombie movie has so effectively used this classic staple of horror in cinema. Followed by multiple sequels, none managed to so sincerely or truly insightfully make use of the themes and ideas they were composed of. The Return of the Living Dead stands alone as one of the best made films of its kind, a defining example of the genre, that both eclipses the original zombie films and even continues to persevere as a film that is worth watching even today.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/09/2016-09-29-review-masterminds-2016.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Before saying anything else, it is important to impart that there are two parts in Masterminds that involve nauseating imagery that may be upsetting to watch. If that’s a deal breaker, you may want to avoid this film regardless of its other merits. That said, Masterminds is a light hearted summer comedy that is emblematic of the humor of Zach Galifianakis, defined by awkward characters in uncomfortable moments of mundanity found even in the most extreme of situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/masterminds-2016/masterminds-best-part.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humor can be pretty subjective, and this is very likely to be a hit or miss for a lot of people. If you’re not already familiar with the work of Zach Galifianakis, there’s a fair sample on YouTube, and you should definitely check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=between+two+ferns&quot;&gt;Between Two Ferns&lt;/a&gt;. It can be reasonably assumed, though, that if an uncomfortable looking bearded man in a long blond wig with cat eyes doesn’t entertain you, this movie may not be for you. While not for everyone, many will find a rich well of humor here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right audience can and will be rewarded with exactly what you would expect from the hairy weird guy in The Hangover getting an entire movie. Those fans will take away from Masterminds a piece that lands somewhere between a fun end of summer comedy and a comedy classic. For me, the standout performance was from Kate McKinnon, who delivered a deadpan performance that had me laughing just about every single time she was on the screen. The movie could have used a lot more of her character, as I looked forward to every time she might be on screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Kate McKinnon stood out from the crowd, that was a reasonably high bar, as just about everyone worked well together. While Galifianakis is the defining character of the piece, the full cast works to deliver something that feels true to the comic stylings of the lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/masterminds-2016/masterminds-banner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the movie really failed for me when it dipped its toe in the shock genre once or twice with images I could honestly live without having in my head. I’m always disappointed when a movie that I otherwise really enjoy is undermined by elements that are not at all essential to the plot and detract a great deal from my enjoyment. While other viewers may differ from me on this, I generally do not enjoy attempts to gross me out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pacing is even and restrained on the whole, though the movie drags a little bit in the middle when the jokes feel a little repetitive when we’re waiting for the climax. When we approach the close of the film, Masterminds rushes into the ending without completely resolving the need to be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole, Masterminds is exactly what it wants to be, which is an average comedy that will hit hardest for those who enjoy a very particular kind of awkward humor. Check out Between Two Ferns, and if you find yourself giggling, then Masterminds is probably a must see for you.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/09/2016-09-27-editorial-inglourious-basterds.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive centered&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/inglourious-basterds/banner.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Will the real Superman please stand up?&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Spoiler Warning: This editorial discusses the themes and plot points of The Inglourious Basterds, and if you haven’t seen it, and want to do so without spoilers, you will need to watch it before reading this piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quentin Tarantino has always been a pioneering and provocative director. With his last three films, The Hateful Eight, Django Unchained, and Inglourious Basterds he has evolved his skill at directing and screenwriting while tackling uncomfortable subject matter. While both Hateful Eight and Django Unchained have been excellent, Inglourious Basterds made me think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/inglourious-basterds/the-bear.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing any movie can do for me is make me think. Quentin Tarantino never did this for me prior to Inglourious Basterds. Sure, he’s fun and his movies are thrilling. But thoughtful? Not so much. His films, prior to Basterds, are pretty straightforward and his characters generally haven’t been complicated. His action is geared toward amperage rather than narrative importance. Tarantino is an energetic director who communicates as much or more information and emotion than the dialog itself through what he captures with the camera and how he uses space and pacing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But have his stories been thoughtful? It depends on who you ask, but I’d argue that even if he has, it hasn’t shone as much as it does in Inglorious Basterds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inglorious Basterds had a profound effect upon me as I watched it. As it progressed I began to enjoy the main characters so much that it became a deeper and deeper sadness to me that they were destined to fail their task, as their goal was to kill Hitler. After all, that’s just not how he died. Three quarters of the way through my first viewing of the movie, I said to myself,  “There’s no way they can win, because that’s just not how the war ended, but… I wish they would anyway. I want to see them go all the way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/inglourious-basterds/center-banner.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I wanted that. Everything inside of me wanted deeply for these wonderful characters to win, to just gloriously triumph. You cannot imagine my complete and utter surprise when Tarantino delivered exactly what I was wishing for, and more. I got so much more than what I wanted as we move into the final act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film goes off the rails right at the climax. Shifting from the sense that all will fail imminently to extreme success. Trapping a theater full of unarmed people in an auditorium with two of the basterds firing mercilessly into the unarmed crowd, laughing maniacally with no regard for their own lives as they die in a suicide bombing. It isn’t a short scene either, indulging deeply in the carnage, and the violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All at once I’m seeing terrorists here, violent “freedom fighters” blowing themselves up on buses, and instead of characters from World War 2 craving violent revenge, which immediately makes me feel that I’m only watching a movie, divorcing me from the moment. What I’m seeing isn’t just the craving of the characters. I feel like I’m seeing the active present day hatred of the Nazis.  This is present and this is intense conviction. This film is modern revenge on people who have been dead for years already, their crimes upward 70 years in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/inglourious-basterds/healing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shift in tone takes me from my reveling in their success, I am transported instantly from a giddy indulgence in a fun and wistful film that goes off the rails. It went where I wanted it to go and then kept going till it turned obscene. Till it turned dark and cancerous in its poisonous hatred.  The joy I wished I could have evaporated in a heartbeat and I was left with a hollow feeling. How did this revenge make anything better for anyone? How is the world supposed to heal from all of that damage if this is still there, festering, and rotting us from the inside?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My stomach began to sink as I felt like an accomplice to this contemporary hatred for relics from the past.  How can a culture move on carrying that weight of hatred? Doesn’t getting better mean letting go, closing the wounds, recognizing it but not judging it? Shouldn’t this level of hatred for a time already long gone be reserved for the actual victims? What does it mean to feel this on their behalf?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had the ending to this movie been milder, though, I wouldn’t have felt any of that. I wouldn’t have spent another minute thinking about it, and I’d have gone on with my life without the slightest interruption. In retrospect, after watching Django Unchained I don’t think that this complex series of emotions are what I was supposed to feel. As drained and conflicted as this made me feel, I just don’t think that I was supposed to feel anything but joy at watching Nazis get killed. That is profoundly sad to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t seen this movie, you should watch it. I’d like to know what you thought of the ending. Did it give you a sense of catharsis that left you feeling triumphant? Or was there a part of you that felt guilty for what you were enjoying?&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/09/2016-09-24-movie-review-magnificent-seven.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;There was no love lost for the movie Magnificent Seven. To punt a pun: it was magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the features that you would expect with a (slightly modernized) rendition of the Old West came in surplus: the cowboy saunter of Denzel, an almost palpable musk from Pratt whilst in the saloon, rolling horse-driven fields and prairies to make up the scene.. It has it all, right down to the spurs and cowboy hats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these elements brought together made for a continually elegant scene, and the camera work was as crisp as could be to benefit from it. This was met however, with a recurring theme of unnecessary close-ups to to our heroes, pulling away from the detail invested into the setting, though somewhat offset by the wide-angle shots of landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each character represented an untold story that only hints were provided for, leaving much to be desired in terms of understanding the starring septet. While this gives an air of mysterious equality amongst the men, it also begs the question of how well utilized the two hours and thirty minutes could be considered when no history is evident beyond a subtle mention here or offhand reference there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there were some minor defects that could be expected from any film, it goes to show that “perfect” is not far from “magnificent”, and I would even say it twice to describe the Magnificent Seven.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/09/2016-09-16-review-blair-witch-2016.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;Blair Witch is a serviceable popcorn flick that is oversaturated with jump scares and loud noises that is better than the original, but doesn’t progress the genre. When a sequel has been this long, coming though, that’s not so bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/blair-witch/blair-witch-clip.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel it’s important to start off by emphasizing that this was overall a solid popcorn film, and it was good enough that it will likely have a long lasting legacy similar to the original. It’s largely flawed, and doesn’t match up to some of the better offerings we have had even this summer, but it’s definitely worth at least one watch. So lets start with what it does really right before getting into where it falls short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where Blair Witch really succeeds is in its improved world building and narrative elements, as well as in presenting us with a set of more likeable protagonists. Unlike the original, I found myself hoping that they might survive, unlike the original where the constant bickering and poor decision making had me hoping for them to die as fast as possible. The film even manages to rise above the jump scares and suspenseful noise that make up the majority of the running time to deliver a few moments of real horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/blair-witch/blair-witch-poster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best scares use body horror to great effect, upending the viewer expectations and delivering on some of the scares that are promised for all too long between deliveries. Where Blair Witch is really weak is its overuse of suspense, constantly trying to make the viewer feel stressed and uncomfortable the entire time. Rather than crafting a curve of emotion and suspense, the movie is more interested in making you jump at nothing. It leaves you almost tired of feeling tense the whole time and ready for the movie to end or at least get to the point about 10 minutes early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is okay for a popcorn flick, because that feeling of being ready for it to be over for only about 10 minutes on a first viewing isn’t terrible. However, this really does keep the film from greatness, as those minutes will grow longer and longer with each viewing. Some tighter editing, and more careful use of audio and visual cues to create more rewarding suspense could have made this an all time classic, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/blair-witch/blair-witch-putting-baby-in-the-corner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do we deserve better than this as an audience? Not really. It would have been nice to have a more lasting well crafted movie, but it’s not fair to discount that what we got is better than the original in every conceivable way. Even if Blair Witch doesn’t evolve the found footage genre, it is most definitely a well composed entry that builds a modern film. It would have been nice to see something that progressed the genre and broke some new ground, though, which hasn’t done anything new since 2012’s Chronicle, which successfully used plot devices to deliver a more steady and deliberate camera movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the movie for a solid horror flick that isn’t too shallow or too deep, delivers a few really great horror moments, and are okay with a few too many cheap jump scares, then Blair Witch will keep you entertained for a good hour and a half. It’s not as good as Don’t Breathe, which was a surprise hit, but it’s not bad, and if you’ve already seen Don’t Breathe and are still in the mood for more scares, then Blair Witch will not disappoint, even if it doesn’t quite satisfy.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/09/2016-09-08-review-sully-2016.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;I want to start this review by disclosing that it’s not possible for me to give an objective review for this movie. Sure, I can go over the technical accomplishments like how it looked, the range of acting, and the execution of the musical score. However, I cannot possibly impartially convey how effective they are to a general audience. This movie hit particularly hard for me, smashing right into a well of emotion left over from that time period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/sully/sullenberger.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sully is a dramatization of the investigation surrounding the forced water landing of a passenger flight on the Hudson river executed by Chelsey Burnett Sullenberger on January 15, 2009. It’s directed by Clint Eastwood, who continues to excel in expertly crafted cinematic experience. He demonstrates a masterful eye in capturing tension in his scenes, elevating often peaceful and subtle moments into of mundane restfulness into frames that stand out for their elegance and beauty. In addition to being able to craft each scene carefully with memorable framing and cinematography, Eastwood also manages to maintain level sense of tone and pacing, carefully crafting the emotional highs and lows of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And everything he does is built on by the capable cast. Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart are in the foreground, but everyone turned out incredible performances for this film, adding richness of character and texture to every scene in the film. Particularly effective is Valerie Mahaffey, who plays Sullenberger’s wife and manages to capture a full range of emotion that helps us feel what she feels, as she is often used to set the audience’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 10px 10px 0px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/sully/hanks-eastwood.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soundtrack doesn’t stand out, but not because it is mundane. It doesn’t stand out because it is used with almost pure utilitarian precision. Musically, the soundtrack never drowns out the film, working entirely in concert with it to convey suspense, fear, dread, and relief. Though technically effective at everything it attempts to accomplish, it never really rises up to provide an experience worthy of independent merit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narratively, Sully manages to do a fantastic job of putting the vast majority of the important context for the film in the background, leaving it as generally subtle subtext, though there were a few moments of careful exposition. That subtext is pretty harsh, though. As a nation, we hadn’t had a whole lot of really good news for a while. We were at the bottom of a financial crisis where people were losing their homes, many of us had friends and family who were deployed in actively dangerous situations, and the memory of the worst attack on American soil in all of our history was still a little fresher in our minds than it is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things aren’t really so different now, when you say all of that out loud, which should make it pretty easy to imagine how good it felt to have a miracle. And I want to say, that this movie delivered something that you just don’t experience hardly ever in a theater: tears of joy. It pulled me right into all of the self doubt and confusion of the investigation, questioning whether or not the danger was even real while making you feel this well crafted sense of PTSD as you get constant flashes of how the crash could have gone to convey the trauma and shock of recovering from a violent near death experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/sully/Valerie-Mahaffey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even knowing how everything turned out in the end, Sully manages to use the events surrounding the crash as much as the crash itself to draw you into the terror of the moment, to give you doubt, and to be afraid for all of the people on that flight. Then it pays you back for investing yourself in these lives and in this in ways I just didn’t know a film was capable of doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all of this, I can tell you that the movie is well made, but I can’t say how well made. It was put together well enough that it triggered me and a lot of memories I have, and at it’s best showed me a time where a lot of very hardworking people pulled together and accomplished something amazing. This was something I really needed to see after the past few months. I teared up a little bit seeing police and rescue crews actually saving people, and it served as a bit of a reminder of what we can do, and the positive difference we can make just by being ready and prepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I can’t begin to tell you impartially how well made the movie needed to be in order to deliver on that experience, because it was definitely good enough to pump the feels right into me. It’s possible that the events may come off as pretentious, or the organization of the story telling may be a little too conveniently arranged in the telling. Trying to see past the really powerful emotions I felt, it’s really hard to see any flaws. The whole movie worked very well. I highly recommend this film, especially to people who need something to feel really good about.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/09/2016-09-02-why-no-one-can-make-good-superman-movies.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive centered&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/superman-movies/super-banner.png&quot; title=&quot;Will the real Superman please stand up?&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should preface this article by making an assertion about the quality of Superman as a character: Superman is not inherently boring. In fact, if you haven’t ever watched Max Landis talk about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw_GlYve_Lg&quot;&gt;what makes Superman special&lt;/a&gt;, I highly recommend that you do right now before going forward. Because I want to start from there, from the idea that part of what makes this character special is that he should be an adult among children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will never be a good Superman movie, because a good movie requires dramatic tension and a sense of agency through which we perceive the story. We can never have that because Superman can never die or lose, and never has to make a hard moral choice. His real power is that he is as strong as he needs to be to survive until he can punch everything better. What we need to see for a Superman story to be good is for him to have the maturity to choose not to use his power because it’s wrong, but we can only ever have him fight against Kryptonite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/superman-movies/emotional-abuse.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As one of our oldest heroes, he should be one of our most mature, and yet, he is one of our least. Even the movie you thought was good wasn’t. Think back to the last time you watched that movie and try to remember the really weird stuff you gloss over, like the ending. Even in our very best Superman movie, we have a part where Superman literally turns back time to save Lois Lane, with a power he never gets to use again, and only works in the absolute silliest way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is that? It’s time to say this out loud: comics do not have the best history of mature story telling. They have a dark history of people with maturity issues writing characters who lack moral ambiguity, and when you have a child deciding absolute morality, it gets weirdly complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have children writing from a vantage where they feel they are writing about absolute morality, you end up with some very weird stories. Stories where what is happening is only really okay from the perspective of the protagonist, and it takes a mature adult to say, “Wait, isn’t it wrong for Superman to follow Lois home at night and spy on her through her walls?” And here’s where we get to the core argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/superman-movies/super-crew.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good story with dramatic tension requires us to be afraid for something. But we can’t be afraid for Superman, or anyone around Superman, and as a voice of absolute right, we can’t be afraid that Superman will make a bad decision. He makes them all the time, but we see his world through the lens of his Superpowers and his emotions and so often we, as readers and viewers fail to point out the real insanity of his actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to why we can’t have dramatic tension, and what we get instead, it’s also really important to note &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; this dramatic tension is taken away. It is carefully removed by never giving Superman, the protagonist of these films, a real choice, robbing him of any sense of agency. He is a pure reactionary force, saving as many people he possibly can by being able to punch everything better. With no capacity for making choices, he is in a very real way reduced to the child like figure that we very easily accept when it’s presented to us. Somehow, this actually works to help us buy into the character weak power fantasy without realizing what we’re giving up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/superman-movies/superjerk.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of our essential tools for creating tension and suspense stripped from our writers, there isn’t much left to do. The only tool left is Kryptonite. When we most need to see Superman choose to not spy on someone because it’s the wrong thing to do, because it makes society fall apart, we get a man weakened with Kryptonite instead. And here’s the interesting thing: this character seems to cause Peter Pan Syndrome in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After removing any sense of choice, being given a voice that represents absolute right, and disabling any sense of genuine social responsibility inherently results in the bizarre character we’re constantly presented with. Superman isn’t an inconsiderate narcissist just because of poor writers, it’s because these very restrictions bring out the worst in any writer. This is exactly how even the best of our Superman movies becomes poisoned. The moment we get a sense that Superman may suffer real loss, we give him a power that lets him take it right back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can this be fixed? Maybe. Can we allow Lois Lane to reject Superman, and then have him make a thoughtful choice that it’s okay, or for once have him put in a place where he’s able to spy on her and have him &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; not to because it’s wrong? Can we allow him to have an Enigma? Not The Riddler, but rather the secret to cracking the enemy codes. A secret so powerful that it can save humanity, but so fragile that he must make the choice to allow innocent people to die in order to preserve the advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/superman-movies/super-chest.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until those creatively responsible for Superman can let him grow up, we can never have a good story from him as a character. We will continually be provided with the same sub par narrative that results in a rich tapestry of extreme immaturity. Until we can allow him to make sacrifices, be unsure about what’s right, and view him through the lens of responsible adults who have to do what’s right to make society function rather than what is emotionally satisfying, we wont get that. In a lot of ways, this really means that the only way to make Superman good, is to make him not Superman anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In so many ways, because he can’t grow up, we’ll always be left with this petty, small, and inconsequential character. He’ll always be just another illusion of morality standing up, puffed and swollen, with everything about him feeling fake from his tights to the cheap painted background draped behind him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not impossible, but it’s pretty safe to say that we’ll probably never get anything better than this. That we can’t be given anything better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t Breathe is, ironically, is a breath of fresh air. This film executes on all of its major themes and ideas with precision and skill from beginning to end, resulting in what can only be called a modern horror classic that deserves to stand as defining icon of the genre. The few flaws Don’t Breathe exhibits don’t detract from the film as a whole. In just a few words, Don’t Breathe sets the bar for writing, directing, acting, and music in modern horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/dont-breathe/the-crew-dont-breathe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the early strengths of the film is in a strong start. It wastes no time on empty character development and jumps immediately into the meat of the film using effective and thoughtful story telling techniques to show us the stories for the characters. The movie follows the key rule of show, don’t tell. This allows it to provide large amounts of information about who are characters are and what their motivations are efficiently, allowing us to dive immediately into the meat of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a strong but brief establishment, the movie dives headfirst into its main premise, which is concise and clearly conveyed in the trailer for the film. Three burglars break into the home of a disabled senior, only to find themselves trapped and at his mercy. They struggle to survive, their one and only advantage his single inequality as they are in his home, where he knows the space. The writing shines even brighter as we dive into his story through their eyes, as the movie takes a sharp turn in the middle from slasher/thriller to real horror. Don’t Breathe is not for the faint of heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/dont-breathe/dont-breathe-official-trailer-clip.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is where the directing really shines. The pacing is incredible through both the first and second act. As we spend our time outside of the house focused very much on the freedom of being able to make noise, damage property, and we’re surrounded as an audience with all the things that are distinctly absent once we move into the house. The sense of the need for silence is immediate and effective, and the director builds a deep and engrossing set of tension that holds up through the majority of the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refreshingly, the movie is incredibly grounded. It spends this time orienting us and providing and expert sense of scale and space for the house so that we can follow along with exactly what is happening. And this is one of the places where the movie leaps to the foreground as a master work of horror: it may play with our sense of space, but it almost never cheats it. Don’t Breathe follows the rules, partly because it has to, but whatever the reason why, it is brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And everything reinforces these rules and the environment containing them: the sound, the music, the spacing and framing of each scene, and even the use of color. When the protagonists are at their most vulnerable, the old man fades into the dark and the whole world begins to feel hostile. That feeling of tension is fresh and grows intensely from the tension between the environment and the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/dont-breathe/stephen-lang-dont-breathe.png&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where does the movie falter? There are a couple of places where some people may find this movie wanting. It falls victim to the tease of having too many moments that feel like a clear ending, only to fake the audience out and keep going. It actually would have been a better film if it had been a little shorter and had just a little less back and forth in the last 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, while Don’t Breathe generally avoids trite dialog (unlike its trailer), there is a key line of dialog that delivers a philosophy that many viewers will not agree with. The movie uses the old man and the environment to deliver a metaphorical monster, the monster of atheism. That’s not going to sit well with some people even though it is well delivered and is woven into the core of the film rather than pushed overtly through an overabundance of exposition, but it does at one point clearly verbalize this message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the movie’s message wont appeal universally, at least it has something to say. It is more than just an empty series of events. I feel that this is a strong point for the movie, and that it makes it a better film overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of that said, if you are at all a fan of horror, suspense, or thrillers, then this is a must see. An example of meticulous film making on every level, using all of the tools available to create an engaging and enthralling story drenched in tense and abrasive atmosphere. Don’t Breathe will be remembered for decades and with good reason, and I highly recommend you watch it.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/08/2016-08-18-ben-hur-2016.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/ben-hur-2016/maxresdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The buzz surrounding 2016’s Ben Hur was pretty bad, and I went in really looking for ways for it to disappoint me. I was pleasantly surprised by a pretty average film that was more frequently competent than bad, and with even a few moments that really shined. The movie builds up to the chariot race near the end as the climax, which works even though it sets it up with some clumsy exposition delivered by the most phoned in performance by Morgan Freeman I have ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exposition, though clumsy, communicates enough nuance that during the race, a fairly long action sequence, we still feel like the characters are making meaningful decisions. This is pretty important, because it’s the difference between an action scene that pauses the film and an action scene that moves the story forward and is a part of the story. We see so much of the former that Ben Hur deserves a lot of credit for delivering the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately after the race the movie manages even to show really interesting insight into the nature of what is happening, cleverly overturning the understanding of what is happening for the audience. It is a surprise and a breathe of fresh air that is maybe all the more fresh for the otherwise by the numbers movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/ben-hur-2016/ben_hur_ver8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, outside of those moments the movie has a lot of stumbles. It frequently stops the story progression to observe strangely framed depictions of Christ during some of his most iconic biblical moments, commenting on how majestic he is. Maybe this works more if you can buy into the performance of Rodrigo Santoro, but he didn’t sell it well enough for me. It felt forced and stilted and while it was clearly intended to frame the narrative of Ben Hur, it grinds it to a halt instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really interesting how this rendition of the story isn’t afraid to just stop and tell you how you’re supposed to feel, when really it should be showing us how to feel. This particularly fails when the narrative of how we should feel contradicts the underlying movement of the plot. When a character miraculously gets everything they want and triumphs in all of their endeavors, but then gets to fix the hollow feeling inside from an empty victory with an apology and forgiveness, it doesn’t work. That character arc comes at no cost when they get absolutely everything they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/ben-hur-2016/ben-hur-looks-more-like-jesus-than-jesus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those detached messages are probably the worst part of the film, though it certainly isn’t the first movie to confuse what it needs to show you with what it needs to tell you. With the exception of Morgan Freeman, most of the other actors deliver competent performances, even if they’re not good enough to sell you on the events of the movie overall. This is more a failing of direction for the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musically and visually the film is unremarkable, with neither particularly servicing the overall plot. There’s better of both in better movies. They’re both serviceable, but they don’t amaze. And, that’s not particularly bad, but why remake this movie to just put average special effects and visuals into it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you absolutely have to see another depiction of the crucifixion, don’t go out of your way to see this movie. What it does well does not outweigh what it does poorly and overall feels very bland. If you’re ever stuck with nothing else to do and nothing better to watch, it’ll do in a pinch, and you may even find it surprisingly enjoyable for a few moments, or potentially religiously edifying, but overall it wont satisfy.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/08/2016-08-11-sausage-party.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/sausage-party/sausage_party.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Sausage Party looks like a comedy, and is marketed as a comedy, it is not. It is a disturbing psychological horror film that serves a double purpose as a well crafted and engrossing nihilist manifesto. My biggest fear before walking into this movie was that I’d be in for a full length feature film with only one real gag. That being the idea that talking object/food/animal cartoons are actually kind of horrible if you really think about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any cheap production could have used that premise to live and die on whether or not they could keep the same gag funny for longer than the trailer that communicated it fine to everyone. But, they didn’t do that. They took that premise and extended it to its full logical conclusion as a metaphor for humanity, citing everything as meaningless, the search for morality empty and pointless in the face of the infinite horror of the nothingness after death, and culminating in an orgy of chaos and destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people may miss this because the film tells so many jokes along the way (whether you find them funny or not). They’ll walk away only consciously aware of the crass jokes and the crude plot blended with the stoner tone, and they’ll either enjoy or hate the movie based on how much they enjoy sexual euphemisms for the full run time of a movie, or how well they can tolerate the most grotesque profanity. A lot of people will like or hate the movie based on the ideas. They’re pretty straightforward and the movie really does everything it can to shout the metaphor out loud: We’re mortal and our lives are short and full of terrifying danger, the things we think of as God are horrifying and predatory, there is no real God, and no afterlife, and this is definitively knowable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/sausage-party/sausage-party-twink.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film pulls this off so much better than its comedy, which is pretty one note.  It’s horrifying to anyone who believes in a structured and logical universe, but it is saying something and I personally believe that is worth a lot of merit. So much of our art doesn’t even try to say anything to us. The ultimate goal to pander to whatever we want to hear in order to part with just a few dollars for entertainment. Moreover, the movie says what it wants to really well for the most part. Leading up to the climax of the film it plays out perfectly, meticulously laying out the horror of existence in a hostile universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the crass humor and language serves a double purpose as deliberately emphasizing at every single moment that our behavior is meaningless and as a celebration of the meaninglessness of behavior and language. Sausage Party feels like it pulls back from the brink right at the peak of the climax as if to yell out, “Just kidding!” The reality, though, is that this is just a brief pause to catch your breath before the real anarchy and destruction begin. A celebration of tearing down all of the structures that formed the belief system of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;&quot; src=&quot;https://img.eskimotv.net/img/articles/sausage-party/bath-salts.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can’t handle the first 30 minutes of the film, get out of the theater, because they take out all of the stops for the last 30. The movie peaks and ends with a pornographic indulgence in anarchist destruction and indulgence in violence, sex, drugs, and profanity. Even when it appears to soften the blow and turn away from the dark shadow of mortality and inescapable omnipresent specter of death (consciously in the foreground, this is never truly abandoned, just tonally ignored to wrap up the film on a note that feels positive) the movie screams that destruction is all there is, and to embrace it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an uncomfortable film to watch, and it didn’t appeal to my personal sense of humor. I think most people will find a good deal of this pretty unpleasant if not outright distasteful, but I have to say that it is a good film. It’s well made, and consistent, thoroughly exploring its ideas and acting with an internal persistence of philosophical vision all the way to the end. I’d recommend it to people with a really base sense of humor or to athiests, nihilists, horror fans, or people who simply enjoy a movie that makes them think and gives them something to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If none of those things sound even remotely like you, avoid this film like the plague.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2016/08/2016-08-06-suicide-squad.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive centered&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/suicide-squad-banner.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Suicide Squad Promo Image&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to start off by saying that the movie was pretty enjoyable while watching it, and I didn’t regret my time in the theater. The action is fairly well paced as it flows from scene to scene. While there are a lot of plot holes in the internal logic and even in the time tables of the story, there’s an emotional logic to it that will prevent it from bothering most people until they stop and think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:right;margin-left:10px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/suicide-squad-poster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can turn off your brain and enjoy a dumb movie for two hours before tearing it apart, go watch it before you read anything else about it. It will do that for you. Ultimately there is more bad than good here, though, and you’ll either forget this movie pretty fast or remember it more for what it does wrong than right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This review stewed for a few extra days, and that really has not been good for it, because it is exactly the type of movie that gets worse as you think about it. It falls further and further apart on reflection because it was never meant to be reflected on. It was meant to be Guardians of the Galaxy DC editions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suicide Squad fails absolutely at being Guardians of the Galaxy. It’s characters are truncated and never get a chance to express individuality. They’re reduced to their most superficial elements, and all of this is reflected in the soundtrack. The film switches you through classic tune after classic tune, a tour of all the best parts, but never more than a taste and never long enough to satisfy a fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you look past what the final cut of the film is trying to force the movie to be, and then examine what it is, all that is left is a mess. The audience is shown scene after scene where sub par writing reaches desperately for fantastic moments, but never once provides the connective tissue to tie the scenes together in the meaningful way they need to be to earn those moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s tragic is this is becoming the fingerprint that defines a DC movie, a collection of almost random scenes that vaguely reflect what could have been great ideas and fall apart because no one cares enough about what’s in between to make them work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you try to move into the climax of your movie by literally having a character pick up a book labeled top secret and then flip out about supposedly finding something out that everyone already clearly knew because it was the point of the entire movie, then it’s obvious that you don’t care how we get from point A to point B. It’s never as bad as two characters completely changing their disposition over a trivia fact, but only because it doesn’t try to change its characters at all, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie wants us to feel like things have changed, but have all the characters stay the same, sitcom style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin-right:10px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/suicide-squad-all-you-get.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people spent a whole lot of time worrying about how Jared Leto would be as the Joker and we just don’t really know because he’s barely in the movie and the parts he is in don’t matter. Maybe he’s fine, we don’t know. We never get a sense of him at all. I’d definitely say that there’s not enough here to see any flaws in his performance, and it was one of the few things I left the theater wanting more of. I want more of this Joker, I want to see what he can do, because it looks like it can be good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do we get instead of the Joker? A walking Deus Ex Machina. A character that is invulnerable to bullets and bombs unless they’re the bullets and bombs that our heroes are using. The movie constantly emphasizes that this is a villain that just cannot be beaten with guns and explosives, and that we need super humans to beat it, and then at the climax of the film all we get is a gun fight, the thing we were consistently told and shown just wouldn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suicide Squad fails at just about every aspect of what it is or tries to be. It fails at being Guardians of the Galaxy, it fails at being a unique interpretation of villainy, it fails at pacing, it fails at character development, and it can’t even make you feel anything real with all of the most real and emotional song from decades of artists that it can possibly cram into its run time. But, at least you’ll get to watch things explode and Margot Robbie’s ass for an hour and change. So, there’s that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that’s all you want, you’ll at least get that. Me, though… I wish we’d gotten something better than this. We could have gotten better. We should have gotten better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I go any further, I’m going to say it: Star Trek: Beyond is a fantastic film and you should see it. Justin Lin has delivered the best this franchise has seen in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J.J. Abrams all but resurrected Star Trek with his reboot of the franchise. You can criticize his use of lens flare as much as you want, but that is the absolute truth. We probably just wouldn’t have Star Trek if he hadn’t delivered a pair of fun action adventures that have entertained millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:right;margin:10px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/star-trek-beyond-poster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, though, the Abrams’ films diverge heavily from the meat of the source material. Objectively, this series is comprised of action movies that felt like Star Trek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Justin Lin’s filmography, it would be fair to expect more of the same, and I don’t think many people would have complained at that. These have been good so far, so why change the formula? That is not what we got, though. What Lin delivered is so much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Justin Lin has given us a Star Trek film that feels like an action film. A lot of people wont even notice the difference. If you’re the type of viewer that keeps thinking about what you’ve seen after you walk out of the theater, though, you will notice the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of great aspects of this film, but where it shines is the layered story telling. The themes of identity that draw on the original crew, thoughtfully approach the affects of a changing world, and push the emotional conflicts of the movie all build upon each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lin treats us to the most complex exploration of these characters that we may have ever seen by pairing them off early and letting each group of characters play off each other with excellent effect. I do mean it when I say he treats us. The movie never feels like it stops for this, even when it gives the viewer time to absorb what is happening. And on top of this, it gives the audience time to think about what they have seen before it clarifies and resolves its narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin:10px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/anton-yelchin-chekov-poster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effect of using exposition by distantly separating it from the events that provoke it is profound. It keeps the movie transparent while at the same time not punishing viewers for paying close attention early on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get to see all of this compounded as Lin heavily weaves metaphor into every aspect of the adventure as well. It is really refreshing to watch a well paced action adventure movie that doesn’t fall apart from all sides as soon as you leave the theater and reflect on what you’ve watched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I’m gushing about the story. It’s really hard not to, but some things have to be said about the other aspects of the movie as well: the acting is playful, engaging, and spot on, the special effects are stunning and expertly crafted, and the music is fun, light, and helps keep up the frequent action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A really special nod goes to Anton Yelchin, who finally had a chance to really put some personality into Chekov. He really brought something excellent to the current crew, who all have as entertaining of a chemistry as the original crew. His outstanding performance is just another highlight around the incredible potential that has been lost too soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth repeating: Star Trek: Beyond is an exceptional film that is easy to recommend to absolutely every type of viewer. A fan would be perfectly justified to consider this one of the best Star Trek movies of all time, one of the best movies of the year, and every single minute of it is worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2015-12-19-movie-review-the-big-short.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;If all you want to know is whether or not a movie is worth watching, here it is: The Big Short is an astounding example of everything done right as all of the writing, dialog, acting, music, and directing fall together pefectly. It all results in a well paced film that will bring out every emotion in your body and leave you tired and worn out, and you must watch this film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive centered&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/The-Big-Short-2015-banner.jpg&quot; title=&quot;The Big Short Promo Image&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For readers who want more, I can tell you that this is probably one of the best performances seen from Christian Bale, who actually became another character for me and not just another version of what we’ve seen in every other movie he’s been in. Steve Carell’s character probably doesn’t fall that far from what we’ve seen from him before, but is emotionally captivating none the less. You get everything you expect from Ryan Gosling, a solid performance that doesn’t knock it out of the park but definitely adds more to the film than many other actors would in that role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brad Pitt delivers a solid performance that is as understated as possible. What’s really impressive about the acting, is that all of these very aggressive actors are blended together perfectly to serve the great picture and pull out the meat of the story for you, and that makes every single one of them superb, even if they don’t show off everything the actor is capable of, because sometimes the hardest thing for an actor to do is let the movie be bigger than they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s easy for actors to do great things with great material. Everything here is fantastic. Each and every character has powerful and memorable dialog to deliver as they give you a tour of the events that make up one of the most difficult times that the majority of Americans alive today have had to live through, and the mess leading up to it. The absolutely phenomenal writing oozes out of every single scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This goes beyond good quips and great sound-bytes and emotional dialog, too. The Big Short delivers accessible and informative views about the tragic oversights and criminal negligence that culminated in the biggest financial crises in decades. More on that later, though, but it’s important to say that what makes the writing in this movie shine so bright is how well it communicates the ideas it feels are important in the middle of a hurricane of ideas and information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And absolutely all of this is pulled together just right by the directing. Adam McKay delivers a thoughtful piece that is well paces, placing your eyes and ears where they need to be to see and here want you need. He blends a tremendous cast from the top billed actors to literally everyone who spends a moment on screen to breathe life into every single concept, regardless of how challenging the ideas are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the pieces of this film come together to elicit powerful emotions, pushing the viewer through fear, terror, joy, trepidation, sadness and ultimately one of the emotions that I have never truly felt from a film before: Rage. This movie should make you angry. It should inspire you to ask what the hell happened and why wasn’t anyone held responsible for the events portrayed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was less than a decade ago and there’s evidence that it’s all happening all over again, and no one is talking about it anymore as people are victimized from the bottom up and completely betrayed by every single system that should exist for the express purpose of serving our interest, from the evaluation of securities, the oversight of legal investments, and the outrageous conflicts of interest and finally ending on a government that did &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; but pay our money to protect the very people responsible for &lt;em&gt;all of it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the only film this year that you have to see, a year filled with nostalgia and quality film making. I highly recommend it to all, and I hope it makes a difference, even if it doesn’t seem to think it will.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2015-11-06-movie-review-spectre.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;float:left;margin:10px;&quot; src=&quot;/img/articles/spectre-poster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Article Image&quot; /&gt;
Casino Royale was a well paced and superior addition to the James Bond franchise, shifting dramatically from the exotic almost science fiction entries from previous years to gripping spy narrative focusing more on espionage and intrigue than gadgets and explosions. It was followed up by the more traditional and forgettable Quantum of Solace before the final turn in Skyfall with a deconstruction of Bond as a character and a Mission Impossible style exploration of the destruction of Bond’s support structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trilogy genuinely felt complete, which tragically undermines Spectre’s attempts to insert itself into the previous narrative with heavy handed gimmicks and exposition based on an increasingly implausible back story forced directly onto Bond’s character. Absolutely everything that is wrong with this movie revolves around attempting to tie it into the narrative of the complete and well resolved trilogy leading up to it. If you’re able to overlook these issues, you’re in for a treat to one of the best action movies of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie opens with one of the best set piece locations of any Bond movie to date, and explores it fantastically, jumping right into one of the better action sequences in recent memory. It’s an aggressive and entertaining start that feels like it’s ready to move the story into interesting places with exciting speed. While the movie fails to capture and maintain this forward momentum, this can hardly be considered a failing as that would have made it one of the rarest of action movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acting is spot on, the directing is well paced  moving the story forward and keeping viewers engaged. The cinematography is a treat with some of the best framed locations and images since Mad Max: Fury Road earlier this year. The music absolutely shines from beginning to end, and the cast of villains is superb, though you may end up asking why Bond is so bad at killing people despite frequently being labeled as an assassin quite heavy handedly. The movie would be about half as long if Bond bothered to check a pulse every once in a while when he gets a breather instead of just running off without a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spectre is a perfectly respectable final outing for Daniel Craig as James Bond, but it definitely isn’t a high note for the series or for Craig’s portrayal of the character. This would have been better if it had been written to stand on its own rather than trying to force its way into an already complete narrative. Spectre will go down in history as relatively forgettable because of that, but here and now it stands as some of the most fun you’ll have this year.&lt;/p&gt;

This movie snuck up on me out of no where. I feel like I should have known about it, though, given how many people I know who have since confessed to having read the novel. I fully intend to give Gone Girl a read after this fantastic film adaptation. There are a few things that may keep a viewer from enjoying this movie, however, which I don’t feel are flaws with the film. Overall, though, I highly recommend viewing it before reading anything else about it as a lot of what makes this movie as good as it is though is the way it carefully manages the revelation of plot twists and important information throughout the run time. This makes a really good discussion of the quality of the film dependent upon information that would constitute significant spoilers. So, you’ll have to trust me, and then read the rest of this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the movie drags and feels predictable, reaching a point where a thoughtful viewer may safely conclude that either everything is as it seems and the movie will be straight forward and mediocre, or a bad twist is in store that will tank the movie for the sake of being surprising, or that there is a really well developed twist coming. This part of the movie is the most difficult to watch. It’s well filmed and acted, and the music is well done, but it feels very straightforward and uninteresting. We’ve seen this movie before, where we slowly see that the supposed victim appear to be the criminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It initially feels so bland that the twists that make up the movie would be a complete surprise if it weren’t for the fact that the film is developed by David Fincher. It’s pretty clear that the movie had places to go with a director like this, and it goes to them. Gone Girl is a brilliant and thoughtful thriller with clever twists and turns all the way up until the end. The list of actors and actresses all deliver brilliant performances and the film itself is technically superb in its execution. The cinematography and direction underline the themes of the film constantly and deliver the story to spectacular effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a must see for fans of genius psychological thrillers and is genius in the horror of the finale. I strongly recommend seeing this film.&lt;/p&gt;
","_posts/archive/2013-12-03-movie-review-double-review-day-frozen-book-thief.markdown":"&lt;p&gt;I sit here tonight, eager to play more of Dishonored GOTYE, which I just started yesterday, but reluctant to do so without taking care of some overdue responsibilities. I’ve seen two movies in the past weeks and I feel that you should know about both of them. You know who you are. And if I don’t write these reviews tonight, already at least a day late, who knows when I will ever write them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##Disney’s Frozen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
	&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FLzfXQSPBOg&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could say I was surprised by this movie, but I’d managed to totally avoid any trailers for it and I didn’t hear anything about it till the buzz exploded that it was just a fantastic film. I’m happy to say that I was not in the least disappointed. I went in expecting a great film and I got one. It’s easily the best film in Disney’s “Disney Film” repertoire of feature animations since Beauty and the Beast. I mean, sure Wreck it Ralph and the most recent Winnie the Pooh were both just stand out amazing movies from the same studio, but this one FEELS like classic Disney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, though, it feels like classic Disney that is relevant. It breaks molds, it’s not a romance, there’s romance in it, but it’s not about a girl getting a guy or vice versa, it’s about being able to connect with the people you’re closest to, which is broader picture type stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie is layered. It’s filled with metaphors, and it has to be. The story is bigger than it really has time for, and frequently feels rushed. There’s more than a few spots where everything feels really cramped together, and in a perfect world and in a perfect movie, it wouldn’t feel that way. Story wise, the pacing is probably the thing with the most issues. I don’t know a good way that this movie could have fixed this. Maybe it needed to be longer, maybe it needed a few less events. Maybe if it didn’t have to have as much comedy as it did, or didn’t have to be a children’s movie it could have cut some of the “fluff” but the fluff was as much of a reason to watch the movie as anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olaf is adorable, and honestly, he’s the type of character who is usually cast with a voice that sounds like nails on a chalkboard to me, but he’s not annoying, his voice is whinny to me, it’s soft and he just sounds so sweet, which works because he is just such a sweet character. Another weak point for the film is the song writing. Some of the songs just don’t work very well for me. They lack a strong structure even though they have some great lines, and they don’t hold the scene together well enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just rough edges though. It’s no a perfect movie, though it felt like with some really careful polishing it could have been. The story is beautiful, complex, and loaded with interesting characters and twists. Many of the songs are noteworthy and extremely well done, getting to the core of the characters and the scene and moving the plot along briskly with lots of character development that works. The characters are very well done, though there are a few two dimensional characters that could have had more depth. This movie is a must watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;##The Book Thief&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
	&lt;iframe width=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/92EBSmxinus&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie is just beautiful. It feels like a movie from my childhood that I forgot. The pacing just feels like something from another decade, everything about it feels ancient and it fits very much with the themes and ideas. There’s more happening than just the main plot line, all of the characters have something going on. This movie is able to convey a lot of sub-textual story telling because of the well know historical background that allows it to include a great deal of history that would otherwise make it very much impossible to tell the whole story in a meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the cinematography to the music and dialog and characters, this movie is simply an excellent example of film making. I hadn’t been impressed by almost anything I had seen at all this year until I saw this movie, and it was like waking up. It was warm and sweet, funny and sad, beautiful and painful and moving. I can recommend this movie without reservation to absolutely anyone, as everything about it is extremely well done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am honestly having trouble thinking of any really rough patches that kept this movie from being amazing. There are a few weak points in the acting, which shouldn’t be taken at face value, because this movie rides so heavily on its child actors it would be astounding if it didn’t have those moments, and what few there are barely cause a hitch in the pacing of the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t read the book that this movie is based on. That doesn’t necessarily mean much, but it’s always weird to me. There are so few book to movie translations I have ever enjoyed, maybe 5 or seven. I do want to read this book very badly now, and see how the movie holds up after reading the book. It would be absolutely fascinating. If you have the chance, though, definitely watch this movie. It’s beautiful, heart wrenching, and extremely well crafted.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mX2HBsHbNZM&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Life of Pi is not just an amazing movie, and you should watch it. It is not just a beautiful script with wonderful actors telling an amazing tale set to vivid and evocative imagery and music that touches on every emotion in the spectrum of human feeling effectively. Yes, it is all of those things, but I also feel that it is the first movie to really prove that a movie can be designed so thoroughly around 3d that the final result simply wouldn’t be quite the same if you saw the movie without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every frame of this film is a work of art, and it is fully aware that its story is allegorical. It plays on it, and it makes a powerful impression with impossible images that each stand out as inspired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie has to be taken as a whole. Some of the decisions feel a little clumsy in the beginning of the movie, but over the course of the plot they make more and more sense. Irrfan Khan as older Pi is one of those choices. As the film opens and as we are introduced to older Pi he seems extraordinarily plain in every way. Even his voice lacks anything compelling. As he narrates it becomes clear that his opening is a brilliant stark contrast against the events, and his voice becomes a calm narrative force when everything else feels terrifying and isolating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enthralling and captivating contrasts fill the entire film beginning to end. Having read the book, the initial trailers didn’t seem to understand what the book meant, or the way it felt. Ang Lee does get it, astoundingly so. Lee gets it and shows it off in the way every animal is captured and in how every single moment is filled with living things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only two criticisms of film would be the dialog for the writer. It comes off as a little cheesy and heavy handed. Rafe Spall does what he can with it, and he does well enough that a lot of people may not even agree that it is a little thin. Being contrasted against the beautiful narrative and dialog of Pi Patel may even be the only reason it felt that way. The other would be a very slight heavy handedness of the emphasis on faith in the narrative toward the middle of the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About three times the movie made statements that felt forced and unnecessary. The symbolic structure of the movie is so well done that it just was not necessary to have it pointed out so many times. Even if you feel that a certain level of it was needed at some points in the film, it goes just a hair too far, and the audience is not quite left to draw their own conclusions despite being told that they should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall Life of Pi is am amazing work, and a film that is worth watching. Try and find the time to go see it because movies like this just do not get made very often and especially not with a budget like this. Vote with your dollars and let them know that they made the right decision when this movie got funded.&lt;/p&gt;
