**Review Transcript**

The Highawaymen tells the true story of two Texas Rangers, portrayed by Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson, as they attempt to take down criminals Bonnie and Clyde.

The Highawaymen suffers from terrible slow pacing and drags on forever. There’s lots of uninteresting scenes- from simple conversations, to getting guns, to practicing gun shooting- it was a chore to put in effort to stay tuned into the film.

A film about criminals on the run and our characters tracking them down should have been tension-filled but there’s hardly any scenes where I felt a real imminent danger. There’s a couple of chase scenes and some gun shooting scenes but because I didn’t care for any of the characters, I could care less what resulted from all these scenes.

The film lacks an emotional connection to the characters as I rarely cared what would happen to them. There is an attempt to connect us emotionally to Kevin Cosner’s character’s wife by showing his worrisome wife show concern as he chooses to venture off on his dangerous criminal chase and I did enjoy that scene.

However, with everything that’s available on Netflix, I can’t recommend that you spend over 2 hours of your life on this very boring movie.
