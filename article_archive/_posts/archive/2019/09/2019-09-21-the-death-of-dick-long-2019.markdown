The Death of Dick Long was one of the best films I saw at Fantastic Fest 2019. It’s incredibly thrilling and surprisingly funny! It’s directed by Daniel Scheinert and is getting a limited release September 27th; specifically playing at Alamo Drafthouse theaters.

When the movie begins, we learn that a man named Dick has died! His band friends Zeke (Michael Abbott Jr.) and Earl (Andre Hyland) don’t want anybody to find out how. Unfortunately, these guys royally suck at keeping this news from spreading. They must avoid the suspicion of those closest to them and the police.

The movie naturally will get the audience to wonder, “Well, how did Dick die?” We strategically are not shown how he died exactly or who specifically was responsible. There’s absolutely no way you will guess how he died and you won’t find out the answer here. All you can guess is that his friends seem to have maybe played a part in it as they are so scared of getting caught. When this question finally does get answered skeletons come out of the closet and it is shocking, believable, and horrid!

Zeke’s wife (Virginia Newcomb) does a magnificent job at playing a concerned well-intentioned woman who is very likeable. “You want me to lie to my friend!?” she argues with Zeke. Little nuances from her character made me really not want to see her discover the startling truth that she is about to learn about someone she loves. There’s a saddening heartbreaking reaction she gives that is understandable but tragic for Zeke. 

Comedy is successfully infused throughout the script of *The Death of Dick Long* The dialogue that the characters deliver is clever and well-timed. I’m not typically a fan of comedy in a movie that’s supposed to be thrilling or suspenseful because that comedy seems like a writer forced it, causing the story and its characters to feel unrealistic. However, in *The Death of Dick Long* it doesn’t feel like the writers wrote their characters to say something absurd; instead, we as the audience get to laugh at some really ridiculous lines that I could imagine these characters actually saying.

Zeke is not the brightest color in the box and I thought to myself, “Why are you doing this?” or “You could have avoided this if you _________________ (fill in the blank)” It bothered me a little bit but because his character is written to be highly reactive and he doesn’t think his actions through, it still felt like this was all in the realm of possibilities.

Who wouldn’t have a good time with Dick Long? You’ll be in suspense. You’ll laugh. You’ll be shocked. Admirable script, intense climax, and pleasing conclusion. Seek this movie out!
