Ad Astra is a mysterious sci-fi adventure directed by James Gray. It stars Brad Pitt who plays an astronaut who goes on a mission to find his lost father who was assumed to be dead for several years. The film has an intriguing premise and a great performance by Pitt whose emotions are often communicated nonverbally. The single flaw with Ad Astra is the pacing- it is a slow burn and so my ultimate verdict is that if you have patience this movie is worth a ticket; it does have a satisfying final act and our protagonist has a great arc. If you get bored easily and need the plot to move along quickly, you can skip Ad Astra.
