*The Addams Family* is directed by Greg Tiernan and Conrad Vernon, the duo who brought us Sausage Party. This animated flick is certainly more appropriate for children as it is rated PG for slightly suggestive humor and action. However I’m not sure who the target audience is for this film. The script got a few laughs out of me but it was primarily due to the sarcasm (which I personally love) that has Addams family members using language that I think will go way over little kids heads. Perhaps people will appreciate the fact that the film doesn’t dumb the vocabulary down. The characters and the voice actors who portray them are the strongest aspects of The Addams family. Oscar Isaac and Charlize Therion voice parents Gomez and Morticia while Chloe Grace Moretz and Finn Wolfhard voice their kids Wednesday and Pugsley. Each character is quirky, has their own set of unique characteristics, and had some interesting dialogue that reflected that.

Unfortunately, the plot is a nightmare- and not in a positive Addams-Family type of way. It’s all over the place, lacking focus and not a single element of it is riveting. *The Addams Family* live in an old spooky mansion infested with rats and spiders. In the neighboring town, Allison Janney plays a greedy TV Show Host named Ms. Needler who wants to see the Addams family dark creepy home go away in order to increase the attractiveness of the new bright colored homes that she is trying to sell. Gomez is concerned that Pugsbey is not prepared for a sword fight he has to win in order to be considered a true Addams. Wednesday is dealing with surface level teenage drama at her new school. 

In regards to 3D animation (not referring to anime) anything that is not Pixar is noticeably *not Pixar*. I am to a point where I am not sure if I should be upset about it since it’s the norm that Pixar animated films look better than any other studios (that I’ve seen). However, it’s an acceptable 3D animated film when put against other studios. I did like how the character and set designers intentionally made everything that the Addams’ family wore or owned, including their home, dark and old. In contrast, the neighboring town was full of bright saturated colors. This communicated the differences between the community and the kooky family.

There’s a good lesson at the heart of the film about being true to who you are. Pugsbey isn’t into sword fighting; he’s into throwing explosives. Wednesday and her new friend at school Parker realize they should dress how they want (despite if it goes against what others say they should look like). It’s just a lesson we’ve all seen before that’s been told in an extremely more compelling way. 

Thankfully, the movie does not overstay its welcome. It’s a fast-paced 87 minutes and tells its mediocre story with its quirky characters acceptably. While I thought the characters were interesting, 0% of me was emotionally invested in the challenges they faced. I mildly enjoyed their sarcastic dialogue. That’s it. The plot truly felt like it could have been cut into three separate thirty minute episodes and I think that’s where this should have landed: on a children’s television station as separate episodes.

Ultimately, *The Addams Family* is a mixed bag. I didn’t love it or hate it. It’s up in the air with how kids will respond to it. If you have yet to see [*Abominable*](https://www.eskimotv.net/articles/2019/09/28/abominable-2019/), that film is truly the better family movie at the moment. If you are eager to see something new or Halloween themed, I don’t think this is a movie you will regret seeing. It happens so quick. At the same time, it’s not a movie I would recommend to run out to see.
