Booksmart is a comedy directed by Olivia Wilde and stars Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein as overachieving high school seniors Amy and Molly. For their entire academic lives, they have never gone out and partied because they were so focused on getting good grades so they can get into good colleges. Molly has an outraged epiphany when she discovers that all the kids who had fun, didn’t study at all, and partied, also got into good colleges. On the last day of school, her and Amy are determined to have the night of their lives to make up for fun times that they missed out on and to prove to their classmates that they truly aren’t just booksmart.

If you can’t relate to the main characters’ over-the-top OCD perfectionist attitude, you’ll be sure to find both characters to be very likeable and interesting. They’re well-defined, are unique, and quirkishly funny. We want to see them accomplish their mission for the night, which proves to be a lot harder than it seems. 

The situations that the girls find themselves in are wildly entertaining and it held my attention from beginning to end. The girls are specifically trying to get to Amy’s crush but they can’t figure out where the party’s at. The pacing of the film moves briskly, as the girls move from party to party coming up against so many comedic obstacles. From bumping into a party no one else showed up to, to getting an Uber ride who turns out to be their principal- there’s so many outrageous situations that despite being over-the-top at times, the characters’ intentions and dialogue made me smile throughout each scene.

The script is clever, hilarious, and heartfelt. There’s scenes where you laugh and scenes where you truly feel the character’s pain. As I mentioned, Booksmart does have some silly over-the-top moments that cause you to have a little suspension of disbelief, but because the characters and dialogue is so entertaining, it’s easy to overlook and still recommend the movie.

Booksmart is the best movie of 2019 so far. Funny, heartfelt, and entertaining.
