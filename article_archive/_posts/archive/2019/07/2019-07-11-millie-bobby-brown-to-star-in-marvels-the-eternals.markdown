In a recent San Diego Comic-Con preview article by Variety, Matt Donnelly reported on the apparent casting of Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown in the new Marvel film, The Eternals. The film, which would be part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's highly anticipated Phase 4, is already reported to star Angelina Jolie, Kumail Nanjiani, and Richard Madden. The film is set to be directed by Chlo√© Zhao, most famously known for directing 2018's critically acclaimed indieThe Rider.

Brown most recently made her big screen debut with Godzilla: King of The Monsters, where she starred as the daughter of two scientists, played by Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler. The star is also currently at the height of her popularity with the third season of Stranger Things making the record for most streams by households in four days for Netflix.

We may not find out whether or not Variety's casting is confirmed until San Diego Comic-Con at Marvel's Hall H panel.
