Ready or not is a horror film starring Samara Weaving who is a newly wed named Grace. Sheâ€™s told the night of her wedding she has to play a game with her in-laws if she wishes to become a part of the hard-to-please family. Eager to begin playing, the game quickly turns violent! Lots of people are going to enjoy Ready or not- the premise is intriguing, the acting is terrific, and is quick paced. While I typically prefer a full-on horror movie, comedy is mixed in undeniably well. This should please those who want some lighthearted moments to ease the tension. The ending is a bit underwhelming and not too surprising but the journey to get there is fun, unique, and entertaining. I give Ready or Not a B.
