*The Happytime Murders* is classified as a Mystery/Crime but is really an adult, crass comedy released by Henson Alternative that attempts to bring together the childhood nostalgia of puppet-related joviality and graphic adult humor. With many felt-filled intimacies, it's safe to say that this film is not one you'll want to bring the whole family to enjoy. However, if you're looking for a crude, gut-busting film to go see with friends, this may be your golden opportunity.

The plot of the movie begins with a series of murders happening to the cast of the in-world sitcom "The Happytime Gang". There is a race to figure out who's committing these crimes and stop them. L.A private investigator Phil Philips, who is paired with his former partner Connie Edwards, embarks on a mission to find the culprit and bring them to justice. The duo then proceeds to end up in many cringy scenarios of 'in the right place in the wrong time'.

Because this movie never aspires to be more than a crude attempt at comedy, whether or not it's enjoyable on any level for you will depend a lot on your sense of humor and subject matter you feel you can overlook. Be forewarned that you’ll experience graphic pornography performed by puppets, incest jokes, and content that absolutely would not be acceptable if it were portrayed solely by human actors.

Although the film makes many small attempts at pointing out societal inequality, it quickly divulges away from that topic to more absurdity. It’s almost as if the film-makers intentionally avoided touching on the serious issue they so clearly alluded to. There were many opportunities to create a serious moment, that would have sent a strong message, but were quickly lost in the flood of lewd content.

While I want to say that the humor in this movie is well-thought-out and clever... I regretfully have to admit that the content borderlines on childish. With scenes that leave little to the imagination and blatantly-insensitive content, it's no wonder this film has yet to beat its contemporary, Crazy Rich Asians, in the box office.

Despite its shortcomings, *The Happytime Murders*, just like all others, has its own audience. While I disagree with small parts, overall, this movie is funny. Hopefully, Henson Alternative will listen to their viewers and create better-quality content for their newly-acquired fanbase. In my humble opinion, this movie is definitely a must see for those who enjoyed The Muppets in their youth.
