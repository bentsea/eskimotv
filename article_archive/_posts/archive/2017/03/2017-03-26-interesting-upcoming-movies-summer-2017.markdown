title: Interesting Upcoming Movies Summer 2017
---

This is a list of upcoming movies in 2017 that we're excited about. Bear in mind that we have not seen these movies. Though these movies look interesting, it is very possible that they may be bad. Some of these have a high risk factor, so please do not take this list as an endorsement for these films. That said, these are the movies we are watching closely for in the upcoming months.

In no particular order:

## Lego Ninjago

An original Lego intellectual property, Ninjago is a weird beast. This made it onto my radar despite a lack of interest in the source material. After a strong trailer and Lego's hot streak after both Lego Movie and The Lego Batman Movie, I want to know more.

## Alien: Covenant

Up until a few months ago, I thought we'd see Neill Blomkamp's Alien 5 before a sequel to Prometheus. The last I had heard, Ridley Scott was still in limbo, waiting on a good script to deliver a great follow up. When the trailer for this came out, it was a pleasant surprise that got me excited for several reasons.

It's exciting to see a Ridley Scott Alien movie that actually includes xenomorphs. The cast is outright interesting, including both Danny McBride and James Franco. Prometheus had mixed results, though, so beware.  Despite any hesitation one might have over the Ridley Scott's follow up to Prometheus, it's hard not to get excited by this trailer:

## Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets

The Fifth Element has forever left a hole in my life for a special type of science fiction. We haven't gotten anything that has scratched that itch since. Valerian has all the ingredients to be a beautiful spiritual successor.

Directed by the Fifth Element director Luc Besson and is an adaptation of the comic that inspired it. The trailer is loaded with style, action, and great music. For those who have waited for a movie that hits the same way as Fifth Element should keep their eyes open for this one.

## Blade Runner 2049

Harison Ford claimed that this was the best script he has ever read, and has returned to be in it. He is also joined by Ryan Gosling, who rocked 2016 with both The Nice Guys and La La Land. It's hard not to feel excited by a new film in one of my favorite sci fi universes made by the original director, Ridley Scott.

That said, the teaser trailer feels weak to me. I'm very much hyped about this movie despite the trailer.

## Ghost in the Shell

There just aren't enough movies that address the concepts of transhumanism. A live action remake of one of the most groundbreaking works of anime, Ghost in the Shell has a lot to draw from. The source material provides a template, including pacing, style, and design to spare. It would be hard not to make something incredible with this source material.

That said, translations are rarely ever done well. Not only that, but there is already a lot who are not happy with Scarlett Johansen as the lead. Most are unhappy with the idea of white washing. Personally, though, I just wonder if there are any other women in Hollywood who can get work as an action star.

However, the trailer is awesome:

## Spiderman: Homecoming

The best part of Captain America: Civil War for me was Spiderman, without question. This was the most fun I have ever had watching Spiderman on film. I'm thrilled for a whole movie that explores this continuity. 

Even better, Marvel is now contributing to the production for Spiderman. It's hard not to get excited over that.

## Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2

It's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, nuff said. If I have to pick a second reason, it's to see baby Groot actually kick ass. There is a new trailer, though:

These are only a few of the films that are on my radar in the coming months. Given the strong entries we've already had this year, 2017 is shaping up to be an excellent year.
