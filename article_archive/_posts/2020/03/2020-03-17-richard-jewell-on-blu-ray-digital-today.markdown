You can buy Richard Jewell digitally, on Blu-Ray, or DVD today! <br>

Richard Jewel is riveting, based on a true story that took place in 1996, and involves a security guard named Richard Jewell who saves people by alerting authorities about a bomb. Jewel gets to be known as a hero for a few days until investigators tragically begin to believe that he staged the event to get attention. Paul Walter Hauser plays Jewel so realistically. The screenplay effectively will cause you to feel sympathetic for everything Richard Jewell and his mother played by Kathy Bates go through. Supporting cast members Sam Rockwell and Olivia Wilde also deliver strong performances; although Oliviaâ€™s portrayal of a reporter not being historically accurate has sparked controversy. Nonetheless, Richard Jewl is entertainingly informative.
