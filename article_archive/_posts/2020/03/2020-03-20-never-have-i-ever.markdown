*Never Have I Ever* is an upcoming Netflix series, produced by Mindy Kaling and starring Maitreyi Ramakrishnan in the lead role as Devi. The show, which premieres on April 27th, is a coming-of-age comedy-drama about the trials and tribulations of a first-generation Indian-American girl who is a sophomore in high school. The first date announcement trailer has now been released to the public, and while it's more of a short teaser, the series already has begun to look promising.

In this short trailer, we see Ramakrishnan debut her role as Devi as she partakes in an amusingly practical and conversational prayer at the makeshift temple in her home, hoping for a better high school year. Just through this small clip, it seems that producer Kaling and the creative minds behind the show are bringing a more realistic and grounded version of the Indian-American experience that is rarely seen on-screen. The dialogue stands out as particularly strong in this clip, as the series seems to already be breaking many of the stereotypes previously attached with so many Indian-American characters. 

The American entertainment industry has seen a real gap for truly strong Indian-American representation onscreen, especially for young adults. Apart from looking to be a truly hilarious new show, *Never Have I Ever* looks to break new ground in terms of representation onscreen and promises to provide a narrative that will feel more authentic and lived-in.
