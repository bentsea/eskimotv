Directed by Makoto Shinkai, Weathering With You is a japanese animated film I would highly recommend for audiences who want to see a compelling love story told through breathtaking anime visuals. 

Once you get past reading subtitles, the story becomes very interesting as our high school protagonist runs away from home and meets a girl who can control the weather and oh boy do I sure wish she could rid Texas humidity. The duo utilize her abilities to launch a business where people can pay to have perfect weather. 

The film uses this fantasy premise to uniquely show these characters becoming close to each other and I genuinely loved the relationship that they shared and the surprises that are eventually revealed. The pacing is a bit slow in the third act and that is largely due to some scenes feeling repetitive and similar to one another. Nevertheless, the final act practically had me in tears. Despite this film being animated, it is rated PG-13 for violence and language. The story, the visuals, and music all make this a film I can confidently recommend.
