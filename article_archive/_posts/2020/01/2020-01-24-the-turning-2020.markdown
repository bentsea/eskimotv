*The Turning* will have horror fans turning their brains off because this film has no plot after the short setup. Instead, it is meaninglessly creepy with no answers until the very end and the final answer isn’t a great payout either as it’s vague and underwhelming. 

After playing a Terminator in *Dark Fate*, Makenzie Davis plays a pushover nanny named Kate to orphans played by *Stranger Things*’ Finn Wolfhard and *Florida Projects*’ Brooklyn Prince. 

The only compliment I can give *The Turning* is the acting-- Finn Wolfhard is always a pleasure to see and he plays a poop bag kid who is creepy, cruel, and defies authority entertainingly well. Makenzie Davis has a charm as a caring nanny and her and Wolfhard’s performances elevated this from being an F. 

The film wastes so much time on eerie vibes that copy so many horror cliches we’ve all seen; from the mirror scare, to fake dreams, and a pool drowning scene- this January cash grab is not worth a full priced ticket.
