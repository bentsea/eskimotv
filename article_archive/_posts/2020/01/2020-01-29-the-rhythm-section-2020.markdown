*The Rhythm Section* was the most boring section of my day, has nothing to do with music, and had me struggling to stay awake. Mark Burnell wrote the screenplay as well as the book and he should probably stick to books because his screenplay is tremendously dull. 

Blake Lively plays Stephanie Patrick, a woman who is trying to figure out who is responsible for the airplane crash that results in her parent’s death.

*John Wick*, *Death Wish*, and even *Peppermint* were more entertaining revenge films. The main issue with *The Rhythm Section* is that it does not get the audience to care for Stephanie or her family-- the only time we ever see them is through silent flashbacks. Therefore, the protagonist’s motivation for revenge feels fake. In addition, the action is depressingly lazy and you can tell they did the bare minimum.
