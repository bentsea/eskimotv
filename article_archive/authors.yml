    editor: true
    bio: David became an editor and web designer for <i>EskimoTV</i> in April of 2019. Film critique was a natural evolution as a creative outlet for the editorial and technical skills he cultivated as the lead knowledgebase editor for a major web hosting company in 2016. He founded and maintained an outlet called <i>Critical Truth</i> until joining forces to collaborate on <i>EskimoTV</i>. As an advocate for creative freedom, a driving force for his perspective as a writer is the belief that how we entertain ourselves as people is an important aspect of who we are that deserves to be discussed thoughtfully. A better understanding of the things you like is a key part of better knowing yourself.
    roles: Film Critic, Writer, and Website Manager
